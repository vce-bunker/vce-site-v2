How to use construction in essays
(things to look for and consider)
- big thing for this author - is perception, and how it shifts and changes
1. The epigraph at the start
  - frames the collection
  - ask about our destiny and what shapes that is society and family 
  - 
who


- charqacters are changing and fluid
- can discuss a lot about the alst sentence fo the story

"I was happilyu at my home in muself,but not in mu old self, my new one".

Lagoon valley
- sstory about tension and of discovery of place and self. But to discover who we are and what we believe in and how choose the internal - deal with 2 versions of angus and outselves. Inner and outer self. Inner - value is the place and hold out desires and dreams. Where we evaluate the expectations and values of the society we live in, Our innter thoughts.
Outer self (UNF)

end of war baby - hopeful possibility

Trope in his short stories
- birds
- most of the shooting would be birds
- spent rest of day stewing over lost chance of birds might have bagged.

War baby
- never really leave ourself, even though we can change our environments we're stuck in this cage and in this mind so we can never escape outselves.

we never really know who mitch is (his name is only revealed really late)

she thought she knew who she was because she put herself into his shoes when youg  when watching the film (parasocial lement)

not being able to escape to your past, or your identity or who you are to say zero of our family our stories have a way of catching up to us is an allusion to the song (the title)

___
The way forward
- go and read the stories, start with valley of the lagoons
- then war baby and every move you make (the collection)
- this powerpoint and presentation will be made available
- start going through and collating notes for these stories
- build vocab in terms of your own word bank

Short stories are short so won't offer an obvious lesson, it is more open, hints, interesting questions
For Malouf's stories everything is subdue, not massive rejection of stereotypes

3rd person
- Element of being "outside of it"
Past tense
- Narrator is like "reflecting" on the past, what learnt from young
References to animals
- Compare human behaviour to animal behaviour, what's in our nature
Significance of natural places
- Stories are about going out
- Also places represent certain ideologies, eg valley of lagoons is not just physical space, but also being transformative


Symbols
- Birds
- Transparent objects
- Mirrors
- Clothing
- Colours


1960-1980
- 1967 refferendum
- Civil rights movement

Expected to write at least 1000 words in year 12 (text response)
Teacher says no way you're writing enough detail for 200 words per paragraph

**The mindset on how to do an argument**
Ok what's the likely prompt going to be
Looking at the evidence, I was thinking well
I could see by reading the story the character was ucertain about his iddentity

I kind of want to show he's showing the millitary gar latching on his identity
	1. Uncomforable w/ dentity
	2. Latched onto this identiy

How can we exppress that ide while drawing on evidence from the text
Need to be more argument focused mindset than the above.
