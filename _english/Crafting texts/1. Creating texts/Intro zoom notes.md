Crafting texts
- protest
- will do 3-4 of these mentor texts

Crafting a nice, engaging, fluent piece of writing about the idea of protest, not a protest, but about the concept or protest, what it means.
vcaa wants you to write about its value, porential outcomes and how it is represented in relation to conflict

Protest - tug of war between power and how things are in the now and how they might possibly be changed in the future

idea is not to debate the legitimacy of the concept of protest, but rather look at the lived experiences of these people that are processes. Eg what lfie was like for an indigenous person in the 1950s or 60s.
Become empathy superheroes, get good at recognizing how people were feeling, what they might have been experiencing and then

The marker just wants an authentic response and interesting engaging piece of writing.

why are people protesting for peace met with violence

Possible directions

- trashing machinery because unemployment
- you have a huge number of choices available at your disposal in terms of what you're actually going to take

You have deliberate choices and control increasing great and meaningful pieces of writing that will also be rewarded wiuth a great mark.

Melbourne - protest capital of the world

- the put forward some amazing ideas that you should grapple with during the 6 week block

whether protests themselves actually achieve something or are they just sort of really performative do we just do them because it makes us look or feel good or do we acrtually feel we are doing something

it;s these protests that are really important in terms of inspiring andf affirming anfd comforting those who are subjected to the injustices and grievances and dto highlight whether or not society acrually cares about what's acruallyoccuring

solemn majoriorty and whether or not that's really is being complicit in our silence in toletrating or justifying what is actually going on. think abou hte ideas that then allow you o explore to debate to struggle with wwjat's 

some students examine the need for protest with regards to our first people and others

it's a long going struyggle and whether or not we're empathetic, whether we care beyond our own individualism

look at the power of voice and the importance of resistance that is behind these particular movements and  whether or not civil disobedience is something that is acrtually necessary if i's going to shift if you'd like what she described as the moral rot or the social rot of any society 
think about it not just from 1912 or 13 but also why protests are necessary with regards to these ongoing struggles and really it struggled for dignitry 

the numbing effect of the media and so it's to a protest really about whether the fangers of total itarianism fashion fascism. It's about breaking free from the constraits. Vonnegut talks abou t the handicaps and therefore the necessitate rebellion or protest even if there is going to be hiuge ramifications and in present 50 pieces of legislation that havbe been introduced in regards to anti protest laws that you can be fined or gaoled for a period of time for daring to protest

start collecting now, be inspired and then look at these mentor texts as exemplars othat can help to inspire in attempt to say meaningfull stuff that I actually care about not only to the examiner byut to a brooader audience.

editorial- features are different and which magazine writes all of a sudden you start toi think about voice and who your audiences are. Where am I going to write a commentary or am I going to deliver a speech there is a muyriad of voices you have at disposal.
try and communicate something meaningful
teachers will offer warning about certain things you shouldn't do
the strongest pieces are the ones that have a strong voice have AA position which the writer IEU is actually defending on an protest and what you actually jave to say so again your teacher will guide you.
don't just regurgitate MLK jr, need to say present things.
teachers know it's rrisky to continue to recalinbrate what you want to say to newr present info, but don'e want hyou to mindlessly regurgitate what you wrote in feb or march that's not going to benefit you

Audience
who are you trying to communicate to (stakeholders), and what do yo uactually want tthem to do
how you are you gonna frame your [piece with them in mind
really tjhink about that
