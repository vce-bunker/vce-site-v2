### Idea brainstorming

**requirements:**
- stand out, be unique, be something that wows the examiner no matter their beliefs- they remember it for a while and it influences their life

**Concept** (what you want to convey)
- Overall topic: protest

protest is something consistent, repeated
mechanism of change
- defined through change and voicing opinions through collevtive effort (demonstrative empathy), rather than a single force. When people come together only then can change happen
- to change a principle or value of society you need lots of people (in what we are studying)
- success relies on silent majority + passive supporters becoming active, rather than convincing those on opposite sides to switch
- ongoing implications of remaining passive - knowing there is the issue but remaining silent by choice
- lack of silent majority's ability to recognize privilege
	- lack of empathy, cowardice, complacency

organized rebellion, conservatism

Why is it bad when no protest?
Dangerous because prevents nation from moving on
- culture of complicity, remaining stagnant

Elitists, dominant normality
veil
brute force
- blacklisted, demonised in media, ridiculed
- ostracised by those in power
- possibly killed
law is a veil which appeals to the middle preventing them from protesting
- look at how those in power do it, in contrast to how those vulnerable aren't doing __
- "maintain civility"
- not saying "remove because inconvenient for us" (the gov), saying they are removing it to "maintain law and order"
- some people might be horrified to realise that this act they don't approve of are done for their sakes, want to protest. Even if they know the protest won't succeed it is an opportunity for them to exercise their morality
what would happen if those in power aren't kept accountable - nothing kept in check
- going against the government as they need change keeping them accountable

## Marking scheme
- demonstrate insightful, deep reflection on the ideas raised by external media about protest
- explicit purpose/reason for writing the piece, appropriate persona
- idea must give opportunity for rich use of vocab/language features, and fancy/deep ways of presenting things
- deep, creative, smart idea (and sub ideas) (like the kind of feeling you get when you read a really cleverly presented psychological/philosophical text)
- show that you are passionate about the topic
