Exam
- 26 October 2026


- don't get focused on numbers
- start writing early
- read widely
- growth comes from adapting to feedback

before the exams the teacher can predict the study score

Don't obsess with the upcoming sac only, need to also thing about exam and other subjects
you need to make that commitment from the first minute

English tutorial program
- get a different teacher
- work closely with them, 50 minutes
- will be working on oral presentation
- probably one on one
- weekly 6th period of English
- "study sessions" on canvas
- they start in term 1


How to start early:
- make sure you have copy of David malouf's complete stories
   - you are looking at the 1st 7 stories only
- Teacher will only hone in on around 3
- learn new words - reading, noting down new words, noting down good ideas you think of
- dedicated English book where you start writing down sentences and ideas

Write in a way that shows the reader you read widely. Incorporate real, recent events.

A lot of teachers are actually examiners. Keep this in mind to encourage you to ask for more feedback

How can our essays stand out in the exam?
- answer the unseen part of the exam, don't just write out the memorized
- write with your emotion

- read opinion pieces, commentaries, articles. Open up your eyes to the big ideas regarding protest, inspire meaningful writing
