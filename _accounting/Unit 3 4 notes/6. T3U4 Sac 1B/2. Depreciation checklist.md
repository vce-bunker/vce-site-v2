Depreciation

The allocation of the cost of the noncurrent asset over its useful life. It spreads the depreciable value of the asset over the years in which it will assist in generating revenue.

---

Accumulated depreciation

The value of the noncurrent asset that has been consumed so far. It is classified as a -NCA and is deducted from the historical cost of the asset in the balance sheet.

---

Carrying value

- The value of the noncurrent asset that is yet to be allocated as expense plus residual value.

- It represents the future economy benefit yet to be consumed by current and future owners.
- It is calculated by deducting the accumulated depreciation from the historical cost of the asset.

---

Depreciable asset

- NCA
- have a finite life
- is depreciated over its life

Whereas, non depreciable:

- infinite life, never used up (eg land)

---

Accrual basis purpose of depreciation (3 marks corrected)

Accrual basis (1) Because a NCA is not fully used in one period, depreciation spreads the cost of the asset over its useful life so that only the part of the asset consumed in the current reporting period is reported and matched against its revenue earnt in order to calculate an accurate net profit.

---

dep'n- relevance in ACCOUNTING REPORTS + why reported at carrying val

Including depreciation is useful for decision making.

In income statement ensures that the revenue the asset earnt in the period is matched against its expenses incurred in order to calculate an accurate net profit.

In balance sheet ensures that assets are reported at carrying value which is useful for decision making as it shows the owner if the asset is nearing the end of its useful life informing their decisions about the asset's replacement.

---

why residual value not included

Not part of <the cost of the asset that will be allocated over (#during) its useful life>

and will not assist in generating revenue, but rather by a future owner.

---

Ethical

Excluding depreciation is unethical as the reports would not include all relevant info and understate expenses (no depreciation expense), overstating net profit in the income statement (1) as well as assets and OE in the balance sheet, presenting the business's performance in a more favourable light (1) and resulting in misleading information being presented to decision makers possibly leading to poor decisions about expense control (1).

Why GST is not included

(in depreciation: depreciation spreads the cost of the nca only. cost of nca is ___)

- even though necessary cost
- does not affect economic benefit provided by asset
- will not contribute to generating revenue
- Instead gst Paid reduces liability to ATO

---

Discuss verifiability and faithful rep when recording dep'n

Depreciation expense is based on estimates for residual value and useful life which cannot be verified by source document, meaning the reports may not be free from bias and will not provide a faithful representation of the firm's performance.

However, this still provides a more faithful representaiton than leaving out the depreciation altogether. (explain why excluding is bad if needed)

---

Cost of a noncurrent asset, Installation fees, delivery, signwriting etc

The original purchase price of the asset excluding GST plus any necessary one off costs involved in getting the ASSET into a location or condition ready for use and will Contribute to generating revenue for the life of the asset

---

registration

Although it is a necessary cost incurred to get the vehicle into a condition ready for use is not a one of cost as it will be consumed within a year.

As it is expected to contribute to revenue only the next 12 months RATHER THAN FOR THE LIFE OF THE ASSET, it is instead a current asset called Prepaid registration

---

Insurance

The annual insurance is not a cost incurred in getting the non current asset into a condition ready for use and will not provide benefit for the life of the asset but rather only for the next 12 months. treated as a current asset called prepaid insurance

---

Loss on disposal of van occurred as:

carrying value of asset > proceeds from its disposal,
caused by under-depreciation
caused by overestimating residual value and/or useful life
Because:
-damaged
-superseded
-low demand
(opposite - good condition, high in demand)

---

Referring to an accounting assumption, explain why it was important to depreciate the Van prior to the disposal.

- Depreciation matches the loss in value of the asset against the revenue it helped to earn in the current period in order to determine an accurate np upholding accrual basis (1).
- The business has used the van in generating revenue for two months after the end of the previous balance day and thus t (1).
    
    his loss in value must be recorded to better reflect the financial
    
    position
    
    of the business at the time of disposal
    

---

Effect of _ method instead of _ {on depreciation}/{on carrying value}

- Under reducing balance profit would be lower by _ due to depreciation expense being _ under reducing balance compared to 1550 under straight line.

if asked for effect on carrying value:

- compare accumulated depreciation
- resulting in a higher/lower carrying value

---

Comparability

Method should not be changed in order to maintain comparability of results between periods. If excluded it will be unclear whether changes over periods are changes in performance or dep'n method

---

**Miscellaneous notes**

read the question
read the dates

the practical is harder than the theory (18 marks) this sac
look at reporting period length, and which reporting period

in sac will be asked to calculate additional period's dep'n

---

Past event: the purchase of delivery van

overdepreciation due to underestimating residual value and useful life

if residual value 0 not applicable

don't forget to close the disposal of van account (1 day acc)

don't say how carrying value is calculated in definition for carrying value

say "running costs" when explaining why something has less/more depreciation expense

if asked for effect on profit must say net profit would be $_ higher/lower

whenever say dep'n is an estimate, HAVE TO mention based on resud value and useful lifes which are estimates

---

as a result of not recording the depreciation assets would be overstated by 1.5k due to accu depn being understated + **carrying value being overstated**. (1m) there would be ne o liabiliyies OE will be overstated by 1.5k due to depreciatione penrse being understated overstating net profit. (specify current + nc if balance sheet)

- also if purchase of nca say the nca increase, carrying value also need to memtion

there would be no impact on the business' cash flow as depreciation does not involve any movement of cash. Rather, **it represents the allocation of the cost of the van over its useful life.** (not "rather it decreases the value of the van")

choosing the most appropriate method of depreciation  will ensure that a more accurate net profit is determined by matching the cos of the asset consumed against the revenue it assisted in earning in the reporting period.

{a consumption of an asset in the form of} {a decrease in assets ([insert asset])}/{an increase in liabilities ([insert liability])} that decreases owner's equity (due to the increase in expenses decreasing net profit) that is not drawings by the owner.

justifying whether fits:

reducing balance is better suited to assets that contribute to generating revenue when it is new and more efficient and productive and less as it ages, allocates more depreciation expense at the start of the useful life and less as it ages, and best reflects the revenue earning pattern of the van.

straight line method is more suited to assets that contribute to revenue evenly over its useful life, doing the same _ when it is old as when it is new and not suited to the revenue earning pattern of the vehicle.
