why is gst not included in the income statement

1. given a bunch of source documents, put one or two of them into the general journal.
    1. one of the things you need to put in is a correcting entry (teacher said this)
    2. explain the impact of not recording one of the given source documents on the acc equation (or maybe this is in another question)
    3. narrations probably
2. There will be a gst general ledger (teacher said this)
    1. use the gst ledger and the given date to describe the transaction (most likely a sales returns because it covers 2 more points- if it is you may be asked to state effect on acc equation or ask how it is classified (negative revenue) or possible reasons for return)
    2. state the source document (probably an invoice because there is an added trick of saying purchase/sale)
    3. why is gst not included in the income statement (teacher stressed on this but I think it is a bit unrelated so not sure if will be included)
3. given a statement of account (most likely for acc receivable)
    1. complete the ledger using the statement of account
    2. could have a purchase return if accounts payable because teacher said many people make mistake on this because purchase return acc does not exist
    3. small chance to be asked “how a Statement of Account can be used to ensure Verifiability and faithful representation?”
    4. there will 100% be a discount/credit term trick question, on this question or in the general journal at the start
        1. why discount is classified as revenue/expense (very likely)
        2. explain the credit term
4. possibly another general journal (single transaction) because the teacher mention this twice??
5. Discuss ethical question, improve credit customer management thing, could be a “capacity to pay or putting them in financial hardship” (probably a 3 marker)
6. turnover stuff, 
    1. analyse the financial indicators 4 mark question, given graph(this was in both past sacs)
    2. there will likely be a identify one other benchmark (special attention to the word “other” since teacher stressed this which makes the whole question seem more probable)
    3. 4 mark question asking for discuss one strategy from each indicator (arto and apto) (or one strategy that helps both (discounts)) (because this was in both past sacs)
