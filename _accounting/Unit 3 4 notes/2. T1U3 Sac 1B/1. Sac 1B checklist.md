sac 2 test points from notes

- sales returns are inverted credit sales with the sales becoming sales returns account
- to be eligible for a discount the cash must be paid **in full** within the required terms
    - will be tested on this as well as the discount date in general
    - this will be the trick in the next sac
- *there is an account for sales returns (because need the value for income statement) but not purchase returns (just decreases inventory)*
- when saying what type of document when it is an invoice need to specify if it is a purchase or sales invoice

know for sac

[memorise (actually don’t because nothing like this in past sacs)] THe Accural basis assumption states that the elements of the reports are recognised when they satisfy rhe definitions and recognition criteria so that accurate profit is calculaed by deducting ecpenses incurrd from revenues earned in a particular period. FOr **credit sales, revenue is recognised as arned, even though the cash has not been received**, because at the point of sale assets (accounts Rectivable) and Owner’s equity increase.

offering credit to everyone and not performing credit checks

| benefits | disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| increase in sales- increase net profit | not acting with integrity |
| reduces administrative expenses (for person doing the credit checks) | increase bad debt - decrease profit |
|  | reduces cash inflows- limits ability to pay accounts payable early and receive discount revenue- decrease net profit |

---

no gst clearing definition (because done in las sac) (also no correcting entry)

represents gst customer charged to the period that is yer to be rectivesd

(explain what the accounts payable on [insert date] represents

need specific discount answers (there will be a discount question)

there will be an ethical

high sales returns:

- change supplier if sales returns are due to poor quality
- improve customer service so that customers buy the correct products first time around

Damaged or faulty inventory must be accepted for return, provided the customer has the source document, and the business (it is the law)
