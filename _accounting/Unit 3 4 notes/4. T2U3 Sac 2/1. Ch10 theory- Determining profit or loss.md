THis allows fot the net profit fto be more accuratey compared to pervious periods.<br><br>It is only revenue and expense accounts that are closed, because only these accounts are used to determine net profit, and these accounts only exist during a particular period.<br>___<br>The recording of closing entries ensures that only revenues earned, and expenses incurred in the current period are included in the calculation of net profit. By including only information that is capable of making a difference to decision-making it will ensure that the owner has the most accurate assessment of the firm’s trading activities. Including items other than revenues and expenses or revenues and expenses that occurred outside the current period, would mean the income statement would contain information that would not be useful for decision making. The information would distort decision making, and may lead to negative consequences for the business and its owner.<br>___<br>Revenues and expenses are closed at the end of the reporting period to determine net profit/net loss and to reset these accounts to zero in preparation for the next reporting period.<br><br>- to transfer revenues and expenses to the profit and loss summary account in order to calculate profit for the current period<br>- to reset revenue and expense accounts to zero in preparation for the next period                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| vGoing concern assumption- Balancing<br>vWhy are asset, liability and capital accounts balanced?<br>Why are assets balanced and not closed?<br>Why are liabilities balanced and not closed? | The going concern assumption states that the life of the business is continuous. As asset, liability and the capital account will exist into the future they are not closed but balanced so that they carry forward into the next period and are not included in the calculation of profit.<br>This assumption allows for asset accounts which will provide a future economic benefit, liability accounts which will result in the transfer of economic resources in the future and the capital account to be balanced and carried forward.<br>___<br>Assets and Liabilities- balanced as they have ongoing balances that carry forward to to the next reporting period as they provide a future economic benefit or result in the transfer of economic resources and must be carried forward.<br>Capital- P/L summary and drawings are transferred to the capital count. The account is balanced and carried forward to the next reporting period.<br>__ <br>discuss question- referring to 2 assumptions discuss why some accounts are balanced and others closed.<br>At the end of the reporting period asset and liability accounts are balanced as they have ongoing balances that carry forward to the next reporting period. Revenue and expense accounts on the other hand are closed off at the end of the reporting period to determine the net profit/loss. When accounts are balanced, the going concern assumption which states the life od the business is continuous, allows for asset accounts that will provide a future efonomic benefit and liability accounts which will result in a transfer of an economic resource in the future should be carried forward to the next reporting period. When closing accounts, the period assumption which states that onoly the revenues earned, and the expenses incurred for the  period are included in the calculation of profit for the current period by closing the balances of these accounts to be reset to zero in preparation for the next reporting period. THis allows for the net profit to be more accurately compared to previous periods. |
