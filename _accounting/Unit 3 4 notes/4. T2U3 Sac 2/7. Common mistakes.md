fair bit of theory on the sac

**Specifics**

- use industry average to assess his business performance with competitors and other business in the industry (if asked to expand)
- Make sure to check date of capital contribution (when doing capital account), **often it is not included**
- always put profit before drawings in the balance sheet and capital account
- *exclude interest from loan if it says including _ interest*
- common trick is they swap the dates of the margin years in the graph to make it look like it increased/decreased instead
- **net off the inv losses and gains** for the income statement

2023 profit margin question

1. read and make sure it’s a possible reason for the trend
2. is it going faster or slower, posiive or negative

e.g

- gross profit margin has gone up, npm has gone down
    - indicating increased markup and worsening expense control
- we have net sales, and
    - we can argue sales returns have gone up

- charlie is very  happy with the firm’s profitability as both gp and np have iproved
- referring to the _ discuss and provide possible reasons for the trend

- why would gpm go up?
    - decrease cost price, decrease selling price (shown in data)
    - which increased sales increasing gp (all links in)
    - increased wages or afvertising possible- increasing sales
    - sales returns increased as gone to cheaper supplier
    - eed to make sure you can talk about relationships, why stuff has happened eg why inv turnover faster (a stat given)- because decrease selling price
    - have to find possible reasons

___

If

- gpm decrease by 5%
- npm decrease by1%

as the gpm decreased by 5% and the npm only decreased by 1%

it could be argued that the business has improved expense control

(understood why)

Something like this in sac

8000

credit saes + gst 22000

you are going to receive all of that from the customer

60% of that is 13200

the discount was 2% which was 264
22000-264=

22000*0.6

balance t start

- credit sales including gst - discount - balance at end to calculate receipts from accouts receivable
- most common error is don’t include gst
- ake off discount and balance at end- difference is what we received during the period.

Need to know for the sac but not noted?

Profit margin question

1. quote data to describe trend
2. direce meaning of data
    1. definitions- (lower average markup/worsening expense control) …% retained …
    2. improve or worsen
3. possible reasons
    1. proportionally formula
    2. link to other info provided eg change in sales
    3. is it the markup or expense control that is more of a problem
4. strategies/event reasons
    1. see strategies to improve profit
5. repeat for the other profit margin (don’t do both at same time)
6. “It is not possible from the information provided the business has achieved favourable profitability due to the lack of information provided.
In order to fully assess the firm’s profitability, other financial indicators, non financial information and other benchmarks need to be considered. It is also worth noting that these indicators are based on historical data and therefore do not take into consideration what may happen in the future.”
7. don’t need to say benchmarks unless specifically asked to

· Must link two indicators

· Deduct one mark if student has not identified improved expense control over ‘other expenses’

· Full marks cannot be awarded if reference has not been made to other indicator/information
