| vImportance of positive net cash flows from operating activities                | Positive net cash fows from operations is important because it means the business is generating sufficient cash from its day-to-day trading activities to meet its operating requiremnts, and also provide cash for investing and financing activities. By contrast, negative net cash flows from operations not only uses any available cash on hand, but also means funds are not being generated for Investing and Financing activities. COntinued in future periods, this would mean no cash to meet payments and, ultimately, an inabiliy to operate (without cash from investing and financing activities) |

CFC benchmarks
There is no set benchmark to which the cash flow cover would be considered satisfactory. However, it can be compared against the past performance, budgeted expectation and industry averages to determine whether it has improved or worsened

reasons for CFC worsening

- decreased CASH sales- decrease cash flows from operating activities
- took out new loan which increased avg current liabilities
