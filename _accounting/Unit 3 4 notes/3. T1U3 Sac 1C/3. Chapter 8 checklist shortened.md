The business can then match the code on the item to the price in its records to identify the exact cost price when determining cost of sales. Therefore this method is accurate and neutral and thus provides a faithful representation of the value of inventory.<br><br>- ensures accuracy as it is based on the actual flow of physical goods- more accurate cost of sales, gross profit and net profit. <br>- ensures a more accurate valuation of inventory on hand fulfilling relevance by providing information that is useful for decision making.<br><br>Cons: <br>sometimes, *it is not possible (eg petrol) or practical (eg apples), or not worth the time, effort and cost to record the exact cost prices*<br><br>**FIFO**<br>FIFO is an easier and less time consuming cost assignment method and is used where it is not possible or practical, or not worth the time, effort and cost to record the exact cost prices. Under FIFO, it is assumed that the inventory that was purchased first will be sold first, *allowing for the determination of Cost of Sales and the calculation of gross profit and net profit.*<br><br>As it still uses cost prices that are verifiable by reference to the source document, FIFO still provides a faithful representation of the value of inventory.<br><br>However, as it is an assumption it may not match the actual flow of goods. Under FIFO there is no way of knowing if the cost prices allocated at the time of the sale were the actual purchase price. Therefore, the valuation of cost of sales and inventory on hand under FIFO is not free from bias and may not faithfully represent the net profit and value of assets of the firm.<br><br>If question mentions cost of sales/inventory on hand mention one of these:<br>- cost of sales is biased toward the inclusion the inventory purchased first<br>- inventory on hand is biased towards the inclusion of inventory purchased last |
