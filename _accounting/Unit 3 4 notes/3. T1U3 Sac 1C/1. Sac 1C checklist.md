In this way, the business could simply match the code on the item to the price in its records to identify the exact cost price when determining cost of sales.<br><br>FIFO<br>FIFO assumes that the first items purchased are the first items sold. FIFO is applied to all transactions recorded in the OUT column of the inventory card (except purchase returns). Adopting this method allows for the determination of Cost of Sales and the calculation Gross Profit and Net Profit. It is an easier cost assignment method and is used when the cost price of an inventory item cannot be identified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Under FIFO there is no way of knowing if the cost prices allocated at the time of the sale ere in fact those which applied to those individual items of inventory at the time of their purchase. Therefore, the valuation of cost of sales and inventory on hand under FIFO is not free from bias and may not faithfully represent the net profit and value of assets of the firm.<br><br>As it still uses cost prices that are verifiable by reference to the source document, FIFO still provides a faithful representation of the value of inventory.<br><br>- no way of knowing if the cost prices allocated were their actual purchase price<br>- therefore cost of sales is biased toward the inclusion of the inventory purchased first |
| Explain the impact of using FIFO on the valuation of Inventory on hand, cost of sales and gross profit in times of rising/falling prices<br>(only mention the ones relevant to question given)                                                             | In times of rising cost prices, FIFO assumes that the older, cheaper items are sold first/newer more expensive items remain on hand.<br><br>- Cost of sales will be lower and Net profit (and gross profit) will be higher than identified cost. <br>- Using identified cost means cost of sales will be higher (and net profit will be lower) as it would be calculated using a combination of expensive and cheaper inventory.<br><br>- Higher valuation of Inventory on hand on the balance sheet than Identified Cost. <br>- Using Identified Cost means, the valuation of Inventory on hand will be lower as the remaining inventory could be a combination of cheaper and expensive inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Therefore, inventory valuation must be changed to ensure that the reports include all expenses incurred in the period (inventory write-down) so that they can be matched against the revenues earned in order to determine an accurate net profit.<br><br>(for exam:)<br>Where NRV falls below cost, it means that the cost price currently in the inventory card is no longer a faithful representation of the value of the inventory. In such a case, the inventory must be revalued to its NRV through a write-down, which represents the [definition]. |

| why is an inventory loss classified as an expense                                 | Inventory loss is an expense as it results in a decrease in assets (Inventory), leading to a decrease in Owner’s equity due to a decrease in net profit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| comparison of fifo and identified cost when prices are falling (unedited version) | rising<br>Impact on net profit<br>Because fifo assumes that the first items purchased are the first sold, in times of rising cost prices it will assume that the:<br><br>older, cheaper items have been sold first. This means that cost of sales will be lower and therefore Net profit will be higher than identified cost. <br>Using identified cost means the specific cost prices are recognised, and a higher cost of sales will likely be reported as it would be calculated using a combination of expensive and cheaper prices resulting in a lower net profit.<br><br>newer, more expensive items of inventory remain on hand, leading to a higher valuation of Inventory on hand than Identified Cost. When using Identified Cost, the valuation of Inventory on hand will be lower due to the fact that the remaining inventory could be a combination of cheaper and expensive inventory, therefore reporting a lower value of inventory on hand. |

which leads to a decrease in owner’s equity due to decrease in profit

check against
- textbook handouts

- misc handouts

- workbook solutions

- past year’s and existing definitions

- shortened and rephrased to the recurring key points and identified marks

- combine the similar questions

- up to: combine the faithful rep into costs and benefits of methods, and shorten and remove repeated things

last accounting test made a lot of easy “didn’t read question” mistakes- check for these first when checking through

state values when answering theory questions eg when saying immaterial say the value

cost of sales and net profit is HIGHER or LOWER (not increase or decrease)
