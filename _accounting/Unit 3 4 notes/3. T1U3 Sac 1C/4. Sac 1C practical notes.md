- can combine in inv card but must split when in general journal
- if on different dates then the transactions must be split in inv card (but the product cost gets combined with the inv rather than adding a new balance item)

(more than one supplier see ch 9 handout page 7

(check if need to say eft pay or just eft)

when ask for sales don’t deduct cost of sales
