Even if accrued increases it is actually the business paying it all off first then accruing more (payment auto prioritises decreasing accrued)

If asked for effect on acc equation, can just say A/L/OE, but if asked for effect on balance sheet do the same except must specify current or non current

Check next few questions (eg the ledger) for the proper names of the accounts (eg if it includes the word “expense” or the name of the acc receivable)

It is always “accrued interest revenue” never accrued interest

In the balance sheet extract if it doesn’t say eg “Current Assets” you have to write it in as it will be worth a mark

read the date (sometimes gives the acc rec at the end which is the balance at the end, sometimes give you one at beginning where you got sales, sales, returns, calc end balance (read it carefully)

Deposit is CL

Past event: receipt of deposit
settlement event: when the goods are provided to the customer

will deduct a mark if you don’t use the term “whereas” or any of its synonyms in a compare or distinguish question

*Before drawing the timeline write out the accounts in the journal so you know what to look out for (unless it is like a thing that you don’t know what transaction will appear)
