| ~~Define Doubtful Debts and Bad Debts~~ | **Bad debts**<br>Debts that must be written off as irrecoverable/uncollectable, because the *Account receivable is unable to pay.*<br><br>**Doubtful debt**<br>Debts that are unlikely to be collected in the future but have not yet been “written off” as irrecoverable as it has not been confirmed that the Account receivable is unable to pay. |

**Other theory** (non checklist)
The adjustment for bad debts recognises in he current period the probable expense incurred as a result of the credit sales made in that period.

This means profit can be calculated accurately by matching revenues earned against expenses incurred in the current period.

Strategies to decrease bad debts

- offering discounts for quick settlement
- sending reminder notices
- conducting extensive credit checks (new customers only)
- threatening legal action (severe)
