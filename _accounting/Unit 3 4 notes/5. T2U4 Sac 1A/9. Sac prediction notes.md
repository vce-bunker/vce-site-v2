Sac prediction notes (as hinted by teacher)

(make sure to go back to the new checklist look at all the bolded stuff)

(miss p’s checklist has extra (unnecessary) stuff)

General:

- mainly marks are for practical, not much theory
- not a lot of theory but it’s quite specific so need to go through (meaning need good understanding because will need to improvise?)

No:

- No income statement
    - won’t need to update the trial balance

Practical:

- 1st question is transferring to the general journal
- lots of general journal
- some adjusting entries
- there will be a question with an extract
- trial balance (but not updating it)
- A prepaid rent expense where they give you the full amount of rent expense at the end of the period
- a question similar to question 3 of the 2023 sac (elliot’s footy accrued interest revenue)
- The sac won’t tell you when you received the term deposit, you must work it out
- there will be a hard accrued interest question
- THERE IS NO ETHICAL QUESTIONS

Theory (* is teacher hinted at more than one time)

- ***doing allowance for DD fulfils what QC's and assumptions- relevance and faithful rep. breaches verifiability (based on an estimate)
    - why do allowance for doubtful debts
    - QC + assumption for BD + allowance for DD
- *qualitative characteristics
- *why do/purpose of balance day adjustments
- a 4 mark discuss question
- Effect on reports for not including prepaid/accrued

Repeat theory questions in past papers

- referring to an accounting assumption {or QCs} discuss the financial and ethical implications of {not preparing BDA’s}/{not recognising the sale at the time of the deposit}
