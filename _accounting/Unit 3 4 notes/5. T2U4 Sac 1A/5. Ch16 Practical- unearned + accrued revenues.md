### Unearned revenue

Unearned sales revenue is basically the only unearned revenue there is.

When customer pays you a bit of the cost of the thing they want to buy to secure the purchase (called a deposit)

| Bank | amount paid |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|       Unearned Sales |  | amount paid |
| Cash deposit received on sale of [item] (rec 123) |  |  |

Note that GST was not recorded/identified as part of the unearned sales.

When the sale actually occurs (when you give the inventory to the customer)

Basically a normal sales transaction but a bit of the Bank/AR is Unearned sales instead

| Unearned sales |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bank/AR              (the part that they hadn’t paid early) |  |  |
|       Sales |  |  |
|       GST Clearing |  |  |
| Cost of Sales |  |  |
|       Inventory |  |  |
| Cash/Credit sale of _ following deposit (rec/inv 123) |  |  |

Note that in the general ledger Unearned sales does not link to GST (and vice versa)

There is No balance day adjustment for unearned revenue yay

It is a current Liability

### Accrued Revenue

When you gain interest within the period but you only receive the cash from the interest after the period (eg monthly period, interest earned _ per month but only receive interest like 2x per annum)

| Accrued interest revenue |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|       Interest revenue |  |  |
| Adjusting entry to record interest revenue earned but not yet received (memo _) |  |  |

As shown, at the end of the period you are treating the revenue as earned and this is noted by storing it in the form of Accrued interest revenue until the cash is received:

Receipt of interest

| Bank |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|       Accrued interest revenue       (previous periods) |  |  |
|       Interest revenue     (the amount in the current period) |  |  |
|       *Term deposit     (only when you receive the investment back at term end)* |  |  |
| Receipt of interest on term deposit (EFT trans.1234) |  |  |

Deduct from Accrued interest revenue instead of increasing revenue when you actually receive the cash from previous periods
