Prepaid expenses

It is like the opposite of credit- you pay first then get the benefit later / over a period of time in the future.

Payment of the rent in advance

| Prepaid rent expense | x |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GST Clearing | x |  |
|       Bank |  | x |
| Cash payment for 12 months rent in advance (EFT Rec.63) |  |  |

Here it is like you are purchasing the rent (and storing it as an asset in prepaid rent expense)
Prepaid rent expense is an asset, as it will provide a future economic benefit; they have not yet been incurred.

Usage of the rent

| Rent expense | x |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|       Prepaid Rent expense |  | x |
| Adjusting entry for rent expense incurred (Memo 51) |  |  |

here you are using up that rent you purchased. At the end of the period you calculate how much of the rent you used up in the period based on the monthly fee.

Another example is insurance, you pay for like a period of time in the future, you haven’t got the benefit from it when you pay.

Prepaid expenses are current assets because at the time of payment, none of the amount has been consumed; it is all a *future* economic benefit

Accrued expenses

Basically “expenses on credit”- the opposite of prepaid expenses. It allows you to access the thing and pay at a later more convenient date

Therefore unlike prepaid expenses the adjusting entry happens first then the payment, and the thing is stored as a liability (in the form of accrued expense) instead of an asset because you haven’t paid yet.

**note that if the business hasn’t paid, it won’t be recorded in any way until the very end of the period** 

| Advertising | x |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|       Accrued advertising |  | x |
| Adjusting entry to record advertising incurred but not yet paid (Memo 44) |  |  |

you need to store it of course because of accrual basis requiring you to record the advertising expense in the period it was incurred

when you actually pay the normal expense transaction happens

| Accrued advertising | amount owed from previous periods |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Advertising | this period |  |
| GST Clearing | x |  |
|       Bank |  | payment |
| Paid Advertising EFT Rec. 23 |  |  |

There are two advertisings here because the benefit was still going in the period you paid for it, so some advertising (the current period’s expense) is not needed to be accrued

another example is wages or electricity

## Overarching question
1. highlight key information (eg the year, markup, periods specified (eg quarterly/yearly))
2. Check the BDAs to see which months are in question
3. draw the timeline (months/period lines only)
4. Write out the journal entries (except the values or any transactions), check for any transactions not stated but need to do (eg receipt of TD)
5. Use the timeline to find the minimum info required to get the values noted in the general journal. eg calculate all monthly rates and mark where received
