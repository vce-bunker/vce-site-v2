Sac is 75 min

- 1 short question
- 1 look a variances and reason. Scenario is easy

Remember to put both cash and credit in the inventory ledger (for both purchases and sales)  (and also returns for both)

Remember to put purchase of inventory and payments to acc payable into the cfc

In sac don't go further than you need to because it might not match (eg the bank value for cfc, if asked for operations)

Can combine accrued wages and wages expense to say just "wages" in the cfc.

If there was no sale of NCA you can calculate dep'n by the difference in acc. Dep'n between prev and budgeted.

Bad debts "written off" - the accounts payable decrease

Write proceeds on disposal of van, not cash sale of van

For dates: put the sales date to the last day of the period (basically everything on last day, but only the first of that date in the column

In the sac the bank will be stated but not profit

There is gst on proceeds

In the sac must read carefully period may not be a year

____

say capital, not capital contribution, in the balance sheet.

It won't tell you if there is a capital contrib, you must check difference from capital and budgeted capital yourself

need to remember how to do reconstructing Acc Depn ledger

MISTAKES

Don't put the profit/loss on disposal into the cash flow statement

State name of

Check for capital

Remember to put gst on allowance for doubtful debts

Don't incorporate sales returns into the cost of sales value in inventory (it is separate bud)

Check for unearned sales revenue to put in cfc

Make sure you don't double negative by accident in excel

Don't forget to convert to cost price/selling price if needed

Don't forget to add/remove gst if needed when moving values between ledgerss

Use the depreciation for the right item

Don't forget to put interest on loan into inc statement (didn't thoroughly scan for expenses)

Remember to check for any accrued/prepaid etc
