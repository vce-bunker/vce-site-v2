note that just need to provide all info, order of info in narrations doesn’t matter

Role of Narrations (don’t need to know)
Because the general journal records a wide variety of transactions it is necessary to give a brief description of the transaction immediately after recording the debit and credit entries. This description is known as a narration which should ‘tell the story’ of what has happened, and also note the source document involved.
