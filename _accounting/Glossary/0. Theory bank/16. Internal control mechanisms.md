**Physical safeguards**
Prevent unauthorised people from accessing a particular asset through barriers e.g fences, padlocks or locked storerooms, and for cash- safes, lock-boxes and lockable cash drawers. If people cannot touch the asset, they have less chance of misusing or misappropriating it.

**Rotation of duties**
Involves ensuring tasks are not always performed by the same employee, so that actions are open to scrutiny by the next employee doing the task. (Also added benefit of multi-skilling  the employees)

**Effective employee training**
Involves ensuring staff are skilled in the use and management  of the assets they use or supervise, reducing likelihood of damage through misuse. Particularly for equipment, but also for protecting staff.
