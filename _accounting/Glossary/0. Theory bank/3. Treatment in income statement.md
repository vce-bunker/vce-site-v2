**With reference to an accounting assumption, explain your treatment of _ in an Income Statement**

- **Referring to an accounting assumption, explain why _ is reported in the Income Statement as an expense.**

1.

Under the Accural basis assumption, a profit for a period is accurately calculated by deducting the expenses incurred from the revenues earned.

2.

Therefore, _ is recognised as a revenue/expense and included in the income statement as they are earned/incurred/consumed during the period and

3.

REVENUE:

causes an increase in assets (bank)/decrease in liabilities that increases owner's equity (net profit),

EXPENSE:

causes a decrease in assets (bank) that decreases owner's equity (net profit), 

4.

and therefore should be included in the calculation of profit for the period.

**Referring to an accounting element, explain how _ would be treated in the Income Statement**

(basically answer it normally)

_ would be treated/classified as a revenue/expense {after the gross profit<placed underneath the adjusted gross profit in the income statement>} as it is/represents a

REVENUE:

an inflow of future economic benefit {(when ___)} in the form of {an increase in assets ([insert asset])}/{a decrease in liabilities ([insert liability])} that increases Owner's Equity (net profit) and is not a capital contribution by the owner.

EXPENSE:

{a consumption of an asset in the form of} {a decrease in assets ([insert asset])}/{an increase in liabilities ([insert liability])} that decreases owner's equity (due to the increase in expenses decreasing net profit) that is not drawings by the owner.

**Cost of goods sold expense (excluding cost of sales)**

*Note: if the item is under cost of goods sold then use cost of goods sold answer (unless explicitly stated) (must say the below or will lose marks)

_ is treated as a cost of goods sold expense as it is a cost that is involved in getting the inventory into a location and condition ready for sale.

_cost of goods sold {expense} is any cost incurred in order to get the inventory into a location/condition ready for use/sale

Why can't just say That increases/decreases "net profit" instead of "owner's equity"?

If cost of sales then instead say represents “cost price of inventory sold”

**Cost of sales** is an expense as it results in a decrease in assets (Inventory) which leads to a decrease in Owner’s equity due to a decrease in net profit. More specifically it is a Cost of Goods Sold expense as it represents the cost price of the inventory sold in the period.

**“Other” in income statement**

 …refers to all revenue/expenses not related to inventory
…result of something else other than inventory.

**Not included in income statement:**

### Examples
**1. Referring to an accounting element, explain how cost of materials used would be treated in the Income Statement**

Cost of materials used would be treated as an expense in the income statement because it is an outflow or consumption of an economic benefit in the form of a decrease in assets (meterials) that decreases Owner's Equity (net profit) and is not a drawing by the owner.

**2. Referring to an accounting assumption, explain why wages is reported in the Income Statement as an expense.**

According to the Accural basis assumption, profit is calculated accurately by deducting the expenses incurred from the revenues earned during the period.

Therefore wages is treated as an expense AND INCLUDED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT AS THEY ARE INCURRED DURING THE PERIOD AND is an outflow or consumption of an economic benefit in the form of a decrease in assets (bank) that decreases owner's equity (net profit).

**Explain why credit sales is classified as a revenue (2marks)**

A credit sale results in an inflow of potential future economic benefit (when the sale is made and goods are provided to the customer), in the form of an increase in assets (accounts receivable) and an increase in owner's equity (net profit through an increase in sales) that is not a contribution by the owner.
