Explain three ethical considerations a business owner has in regard to their non-current assets

1. The business should consider buying locally produced non-current assets to support the Australian economy. This helps the business develop a reputation for being socially responsible, attracting more customers knowing that decisions made by the owner are in the best interest of the local economy. This will increase sales and net profit.
2. When deciding to purchase a noncurrent asset, the owner should investigate its impact on the environment. For example, purchasing a vehicale that does not release high levels of emissions into the environment would be the preferred option in terms of ethical behaviour.
3. Machinery must have all safety features in place to protect workers and electrical equipment has regular safety checks to ensure it is compliant and safe to use. It is the law for owners/managers to ensure that they provide a safe working environment by making sure their noncurrent assets within the business are not potentially dangerous.

Note: may need to say “however…” at the end of each
