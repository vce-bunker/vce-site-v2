Referring to a qualitative characteristic, explain the importance of source documents in the accounting process. (1-3 marks)

Verifiability requires that an amount recorded is faithfully represented, ensuring that all users of the reports reach the same conclusion.
Source documents provide the evidence that the transactions have occurred along with the details of every transaction. This ensures that amounts recorded can be checked against the details contained in the source document assuring users that the information presented is complete, free from material error and neutral without bias. Verifiability is maintained through the retention of source documents used to record the transactions, which can in turn be checked through the process of auditing.

Alternative version
Source documents provide evidence that a transaction has occurred and the details of each transaction. This ensures that the data recorded is Verifiable (by being supported by evidence), and that independent individuals can reach a consensus that the Accounting reports provide a Faithful representation of the firm's transactions: complete, free from bias and without error.
