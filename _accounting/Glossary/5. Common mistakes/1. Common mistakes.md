- if there is only one item in a report, for income statement must move right one column, for cash flow statement it is optional
- If there are multiple transactions on the same day, if it is under the same document you do not rewrite the receipt or the date, but you combine the bank. If it a different document then you treat it as a completely separate thing, doing the opposite
- need to explicitly state the assumption/qc if it asks to refer. (state it separate to the question)

- **check if cash or credit purchase**, see if there is an invoice if doesn’t say
- check if the transaction says “each” or not

- cost of sales need to subtract sales returns
- cannot put discount expense in example for “decrease revenue but not bank”
- leave a blank row underneath add other revenue for the running total

- if asks calculate the [cost of sales] for the year ended… and there is a list of transactions (with one outlier being a different product), you must include that product in the calculated (because not just cost of sales for that specific item)

- say every point e.g. increasing _ which increases _ which increases _ every little step
- use as much excel formulas as possible, so that in case you eg did something wrong at the start it will update all the rest of the stuff

**There is gst on**

rent expense
Insurance
Advertising

**No gst on** 
Wages
Interest expense

Balance sheet

- check for drawings of inventory
- check if there is an existing loan tha is paid at the end of each period, include it even if it is not stated in the lsit of transactions (unless there is a reason it didn’t occur that period)

Quick notes

- when owner contribute nca with loan it goes into the same transaction in the general journal
- loan and interest on loan is merged (if under same source document) in the general ledger
- must mention the word liquidity when doing a turnover question
- there are never any cash refunds
- don’t put values in narration
- don’t need to put debits first in general journal
- the past event for account payable is credit purchases of **inventory**
- always do narrations unless otherwise stated
- received (cash) and charged (credit) on sales
- credit note states the price of the inventory for sales return (use this in fifo)
- past event for overdraft is not arrangemnt for overdraft facility, it is as a result of cash outflows exceeding the bank balance, and then “within 12 months of the end of the reporting period when the business makes a cash deposit greater than the balance owing”.
- mention “cross-checking” when describing statement of account
- discuss- say both pros and cons

Ethical

- For ethical questions always state effect on income statement (net profit)
- for discuss questions say benefit and disadvantages
- worsening relationships with supplier/reputation with customer
