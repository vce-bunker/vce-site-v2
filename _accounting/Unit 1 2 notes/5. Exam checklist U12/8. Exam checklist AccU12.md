Practice test

**Purpose and benefit of using inventory cards**

- It assists in the reordering of inventory
- Fast and slow moving lines can be identified
- detect inv loss/gain

**Cost assignment method- identified cost and FIFO- explain and effect on profit**

- Because FIFO assumes that the first items purchased are the first items sold, in times of falling cost prices it will assume that older, more expensive items have been sold first. This means that under FIFO, Cost of sales will be higher and therefore Net Profit and Owner’s equity will be lower than Identified Cost. Using Identified cost means the specific cost prices are recognised, and a lower Cost of sales will likely be reported as it would be calculated using a combination of cheaper and more recent cost prices resulting in a higher Net profit and Owner’s equity.
