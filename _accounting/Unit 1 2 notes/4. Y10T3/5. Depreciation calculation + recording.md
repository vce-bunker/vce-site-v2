Effect of depreciation on the accounting equation

|  | Increase/Decrease/No effect | Amount $ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Assets | Decrease carrying value x (^ Acc. Dep’n- item)        Decrease | x |
| Liabilities | No effect |  |
| Owner’s Equity | Decrease Net profit x (^ Dep’n - item)                      Increase | x |

**Depreciation- straight line method**

The straight line method assumes that the non current asset being depreciated will contribute evenly to revenue, doing the same job when it is old and when it is new. This method allocates the same amount of depreciation expense in each reporting period and is calculated as a percentage of the historical cost of the asset. Typically, this would include assets such as Office Furniture and Fixtures and fittings.

Example

- Bob the builder has trucks to help his company
- His trucks at 30 June 1984 had a residual value of 5000
- He purchased a new truck on 1 Jan 1985 costing 82500 incl. GST
- The trucks are depreciated at a rate of 145/12% per annum
-

| Old | New |
| --- | --- |
| 150000*(145/12%) = 18125 | 75000*(145/12%)*(6/12) =  |
