- Important details to remember

Balance
sheet

When
put materials in balandce sheet say "purchase of materials"

And
equipment --> purchase of equipmemnt

- Bank
goes into liabilities in balance sheet if negative (it is overdraft but still
called "bank")/

If
the ending bank balance is negative then remember to put it as bank overdraft
in equities

- When
putting loan, remember to make it 12 months, not 1 month (because current
liability is 12 months)

New balance sheet- Capital = opening balance + capital
contribution (same for updating other things)

- When updating balance sheet drawings, look out for drawings
of inventory as well

Cash
flow statement

Loan
repayment & receipt of loan in financial acticities, but interest of loan
is in operating

Interest
on loan is a expense

Income
statement

If
the fees has a name then add that (eg moving fees in cash receipts journal)-
Cash moving fees in Income statement

- If
it is a net loss then at the bottom of income statement add a
"(loss)" so it is "net profit (loss)"
- In
income statement for expenses title write less other expenses

Other

Called "interest received"

If there is a gst payable in sundries then it is a
gst settlement

Receipts from accounts receivable- the cash that the
customers give you to pay you back
