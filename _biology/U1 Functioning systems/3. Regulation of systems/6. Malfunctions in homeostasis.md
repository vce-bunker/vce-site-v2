Diagnosal

- blood test

Cause

- graves’ disease

What happens

Treatment

- beta-blockers and anti-thyroid drugs
- radioactive iodine to kill cells in thyroid
- remove/partly remove thyroid

other notes

CHolestrerol- glycoprotein (lipid protein)

- transport lipids through bloodstream
- high/low density forms (HDL
- high density (smaller molecule and doesn’t stick to artery)- lipids to muscles for energy
- low density- when too much fat/energy, fat goes to fat stores

Endocrine system:

glands, hormones, receptors

primary function: regulate bodily processes

don’e need to know the receptors- examples slide

need to know t3 and t4 but not the actual name

pituitary gland- master gland
