**The physical and chemical breakfown of food into a form that is useable by organisms**

| Physical      | Chemical                                             |

Steps of digestion

ingestion (teeth, saliva, tongue) → digestion (digestive tract) → Absorption (small intestine) → elimination/egestion

### Parts of the digestive system

1. Oral cavity - teeth. Amylase (enzyme) breaks starch into disaccharide
2. Salivary glands - produce and release saliva which lubricates food
3. Oesophagus - peristalsis
4. Stomach- Chemical digestion, temporary storage and churning
    
    Protease (pepsin), lipase and gastric juices secreted
    
5. Liver- regulates metabolism, removes toxins and processes nutrients.
    
    store glucose
    
    Bile production
    
6. Gallbladder- stores and concentrates bile before releasing to intetine
7. Pancreas- creates enzymes to release into the small intestine. 
    
    Also produces insulin and glucagon
    
    **Sodium bicarbonate produced which neutralises stomach acids in the chyme**
    
8. Small intestine- absorbs nutrients from food
Enzymes break down food products to facilitate nutrient and water absorption.
absorb nutrients to the circulatory system
9. large intestine- water is absorbed with soluble compounds like vitamins and minerals; undigested food leaves the body as faeces
10. appendix: plays a role in immune function
11. rectum: stores faeces
12. Anus: where faeces are expelled

Omnivores

- gut microbiota
- sharp and blunt teeth

Carnivores

- simple and short digestive system
- gut microbiota
- sharp teeth

Herbivores

- cellulose (component of cell walls) is hard to digest
- longer digestive system
- far greater amount of microbiota
- flat teeth- grinding
- Hindgut and foregut fermenters

| Hindgut fermenters                                                    | Foregut fermenters                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| After the stomach (where small and large intestines join)             | Before the stomach                                                                    |
| Caecum- a pouch where the small and large intestines join             | In animals that regurgitate, it is called the rumen                                   |
| Advantage- fast digestion<br>Disadvantage- not all nutrients absorbed | Advantage- the nutrients can be absorbed in the small intestine<br>Disadvantage- slow |
