Vascular plants contain vascular tissue which is responsible for transporting water and minerals throughout the plant

In vascular plants, soecualised cells carry out specific functions such as the transport of nutrients and water, and acquiring ATP energy via photosynthesis

THey

- contain vascular tissue
- more complex
- eg trees, rose bush, cactus, tomatoes

Non-vascular plants such as moss, do not contain vascular tissue and only require simplified tissues to function

They

- do not contain vascular tissue
- simplified tissues ,high SA-V, easy diffusion
- e.g mosses
