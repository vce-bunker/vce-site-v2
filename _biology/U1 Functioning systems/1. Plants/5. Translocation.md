The movement of nutrients (in a plant), from a source to a destination

Example:

- reword this when understand

1.Glucose is produced in the leaf cells and pumped into the companion cells, where they diffuse into the sieve cells of the phloem

2.Increased concentration in the sieve cells causes water to diffuse in from the xylem, increasing pressure (turgor pressure) in the sieve cells

3.The increase in turgor pressure pushes the liquid in the phloem throughout the plant, where glucose will be actively transported into the required cells

4.Once glucose is unloaded into the sink cells, the concentration in the phloem is reduced and water will diffuse back into the xylem

- when there is a lot of sun, the plant produces more carbohydrates and stores it into the roots. When there is less sun the roots bring some of the carbohydrates up.
