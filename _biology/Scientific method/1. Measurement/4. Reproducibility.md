can it be done in another environment?

the closeness of the agreement between successive measurements of the same quantity being measured, carried out under under changed conditions of measurement
Conditions:
- all the ones from repeatability
- different time (instead of over short time period)

- closeness of agreement between independent results obtained with the same method on identical test material but under **different** conditions ().
    
    *different observer, different apparatus and different conditions/laboratory*
    
- Refers to the **degree of agreement** between the results of experiments conducted by **different students**, working under **different conditions**, generally using **different equipment** at **different times** and often using **different methods** of investigation.
- A measurement can be described as ‘reproducible’ in quality when a **new investigation** under equivalent (but **not identical**) **conditions** produces the same or **similar results**.
- Particularly important for scientists because it can **confirm the findings** achieved in one laboratory by other scientists elsewhere in the world, and **establish methodologies** that other scientists can **modify** and **enhance**.
- Experiments that use **subjective human judgement**(s), involve **small sample sizes** or **insufficient trials** may also yield results that may not be **reproducible**.

Measures whether the results of an entire study or experiment by one researcher or research group can be reproduced by other independent groups.
