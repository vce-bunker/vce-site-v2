how closely a set of measurement values agree with each other.
Refers to measurement results that are **close to each other**.

Similar results are obtained when experiment repeated. Be wary of whether you are discussing precision of the equipment used in the method (eg: is it more precise to use a beaker or micropipette when measuring 1.5ml of water) or precision of results (do the results agree with each other / are they concordant) .

Gives no indication of how close the measurements are to the true value and is therefore a separate consideration to accuracy

- If a given substance was weighed give times, and a mass of 2.70g was obtained each time, then the experimental data are **precise**.
- However, if there is no indication of how close the results are to the true value or if there is no standard reference against which these measurements can be compared, then the degree of accuracy cannot be determined.
- To obtain more precise results, experimenters must minimise **random** errors.
- Use number of decimal places available from equipment.
