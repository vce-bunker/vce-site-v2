the closeness of the agreement between the results of successive measurements of the same quantity being measured, carried out under the same conditions of measurement.
Conditions include:
- the same measurement procedure, observer, measuring instrument (and used under same conditions), location, and repetition over a short period of time.

- Closeness of agreement between independent results obtained with the same method on identical test material, under **the same** conditions (.
    
    *same observer, same apparatus and same conditions/laboratory).*
    

the experiment is repeated multiple times by the same person and materials

- Refers to the **precision**, or degree of agreement, obtained when a set of **replicate measurement results** are produced by the **same student** (or group of students), using the **same method** and **equipment**, under the **same conditions**, over a short timeframe.
- A measurement can be described as **‘repeatable’** in quality when repetition under the **same conditions** gives the same or **similar results**.
- The purpose of reproducing experiments include **checking precision** and uncovering any **systematic errors** that may affect **accuracy**.
- Experiments that use **subjective human judgement**(s), involve **small sample sizes** or **insufficient trials** may also yield results that may not be **repeatable**.

Measures the variation in measurements taken by a single instrument, person or team under the same conditions.
