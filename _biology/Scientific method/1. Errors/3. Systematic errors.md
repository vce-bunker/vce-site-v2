| **Effect on results + treatment**<br>Affects all results in the same way<br><br>**Biases** the results (i.e. takes it in **one direction**) **above** or **below** what would usually be measured.<br><br>Affects **accuracy** of a measurement and cause readings to differ from the true value by a consistent amount each time a measurement is made, so that all the readings are shifted in one direction from the true value.                                                                                 |
| **Cause**<br>• Causes of systematic errors include:<br>    ◦ Measuring instruments that are **incorrectly calibrated**<br>    ◦ Using equipment **incorrectly**<br>    ◦ **Flawed** experimental **method**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Avoided by:**<br>• The effects of systematic errors can be **reduced** by taking actions such as:<br>    ◦ Making sure measuring instruments are **operating correctly** + calibrated<br>    ◦ **Checking experimental method** to ensure that an incorrect procedure or method is not being repeated<br>    ◦ Use the equipment properly. Ensure you have been trained to use the equipment.<br><br>Cannot be corrected/improved by repeating the experiment/measurement<br>**Cannot** be overcome by averaging. |
| **Examples**<br>Eg: Uncalibrated equipment. (not a human error? check)<br>• using a stretched measuring tape<br>• Scale that always reads too high or low<br>• reading an indicator from a poor angle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
