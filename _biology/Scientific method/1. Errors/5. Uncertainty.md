The uncertainty of the result of a measurement reflects the lack of exact knowledge of the value of the quantity being measured. VCE Biology requires only a qualitative treatment of uncertainty. When evaluating personally sourced or provided data, students should be able to identify contradictory, provisional and incomplete data including possible sources of bias.

*The uncertainty of the result of a measurement reflects the lack of exact knowledge of the value of the quantity being measured. VCE Biology requires only a qualitative treatment of uncertainty.

An **error** is the difference between the actual value and the measured value, while an **uncertainty** is an estimate of the range of possible values that the actual value could be within, based on the reliability of the measurement.
