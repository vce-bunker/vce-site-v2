| **Details**<br>include **mistakes/blunders or miscalculations**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Effect on results + treatment**<br>Should be **eliminated by performing the experiment again correctly** the next time and therefore do not form part of an analysis of data quality.<br><br>If you know you have made such a mistake, you cannot use the results (excluded). |
| **Cause**<br>**Faults** introduced as a result of the observer's fault, such as **carelessness** in taking observations                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Identified by:**<br>Can be identified if if multiple measurements are made or if one person checks the work of another.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Avoided by:**<br>Can be avoided by being careful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Examples**<br>E.g. spilling part of a solution, dropping part of a solid from the weighing paper, doing a calculation wrong.                                                                                                                                                  |
