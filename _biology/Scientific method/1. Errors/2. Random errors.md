| **Details**<br>Present in **all measurements** except for measurements involving counting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Effect on results + treatment**<br>an unpredictable variation in the readings obtained<br><br>affect the **precision** of a measurement<br><br>**Equally likely** to result in the measured value being **above** or **below** what would usually be measured.<br><br>resulting in the readings being higher or lower than expected<br><br>**result in a spread of readings**                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Cause**<br>random is change randomly because of controlled not being controlled<br>due to variables not all being controlled (extraneous variables)<br><br>unpredictable variations in the measurement process<br><br>Occur because instruments are affected by **small variations** in their **surroundings** such as changes in temperature.<br><br>the **procedure** of the experimental trial (thus present in only that trial)                                                                                                                        |
| **Identified by:**<br>random errors were present in the experiment as it is clear that there are differences in measurements between the three trials measuring the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide  or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Reduced by:**<br>• The effects of random errors can be **reduced** by taking actions such as:<br>    ◦ Making multiple (more or **repeated**) measurements<br>    ◦ Calculating a new **mean**, excluding outliers<br>    ◦ Increasing sample sizes<br>    ◦ refining the **measurement method** or technique                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Examples**<br>• Timing depends on reaction time<br>• People take turns taking readings<br>• Rounding values up or down<br>• variations in estimating a quantity that lies between the graduations (lines) on a measuring instrument<br>• the inability to read an instrument because the reading fluctuates during the measurement.<br>• a student repeatedly weights a beaker with solution and gets different measurements every time<br>• When getting a pressure reading, students were entering and exiting the lab, causing the pressure to be lower |
