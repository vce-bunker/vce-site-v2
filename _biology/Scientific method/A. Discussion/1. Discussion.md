Describe all patterns/trends (similarities, etc)

Theoretical was consistently higher than experimental _ by an average of _
The greatest difference was _ and the lowest difer,f.

Why is there a similarity or difference in data
Reference specify data

At least 2 trends then explain them

linear?

For the bio EPi you only need one error and one limitaition. For the error state the type of error an an improvement. Don’t need to expand on limitation, just state it and its cause.

Everyday situation, not make rollercoaster

maybe good to link back to the situation described in the task sheet (if there was one)

Construct evidence-based arguments and draw conclusions
Discussion

- This section examines whether the data obtained supports the hypothesis, explores the implications of the findings and judges the potential limitations of the experimental design.
- It focuses on a question of understanding ‘What is the meaning and/or the significance of my investigation results?’
- This involves analysis in explaining what the results clearly indicate, what has been found and what is known with certainty based on results as well as interpretation in explaining the significance of results, identifying ambiguities and further questions that arise, and finding logical explanations for problems in the data.
- In this section, you should:
- Show clearly whether the data supports, partly supports or refutes the hypothesis by stating the relationships or correlations the data indicates between independent and dependent variables. Discuss patterns, trends or relationships in the data.

The relationship between the evidence and the conclusions drawn from the evidence should be made explicit. The terms ‘proved’, ‘disproved’, ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’ in relation to the hypothesis should be avoided since this level of certainty may be unlikely in a single investigation; terms such as ‘supported’, ‘indicated’ and ‘suggested’ are more appropriate to evaluate the hypothesis.

////////

- Compare expected results with those obtained, analyse experimental design and errors and acknowledge any anomalous data or deviations from what was predicted.
- Ignoring data that contradicts claims or predictions is a departure from scientific method.
- Such data should be acknowledged, examined carefully and, where possible, the procedure should be repeated to obtain further data.
- If replication is not possible then **flaws/errors** in the procedure or investigation design should be identified and you should discuss how and why the procedure or investigation design may have affected the data, and **how the procedure or investigation design could be changed** to eliminate – or **minimise the effects** of – the identified flaws.
- Relate findings to earlier work undertaken in the area under investigation. The investigation will be an extension of previous theoretical understandings and investigations undertaken and these should be discussed in relation to your own data.
- Discuss **limitations** of the investigation design and **suggested improvements** could be summarised, **possible future work that could be done** to refine or extend conclusions could be identified and/or the implications of conclusions could be explained.

A discussion should include:

- **Interpret** the **trends** and **patterns** in the data.
    - Refer to a graph if possible, as this will clearly show the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
    - Quote relevant data from the table or graph when referring to trends in the data.
- **Evaluate** the **trends** and **patterns in the data**.
    - Refer to relevant **biological concepts** to draw meaningful conclusions from results.
- Acknowledge any deviations (**outliers**) in the data.

○Relate the results to the relevant biological theory and key terms.

- State whether the data you collected **supports** or **does not support** the **hypothesis**.
- Identify any **limitations** in the data or the method.
    - Refer to **random** and **systematic** errors.
    - Analyse the quality of data in terms of **accuracy**, **precision**, **validity**, **reliability** and **reproducibility**.
- **Suggest future improvements** to the investigation if it were to be performed again.

○Referring to experimental errors, not personal errors. If your experiment is performed correctly, there should be no personal errors.

- Avoid terms such as ‘proved’, ‘disproved’, ‘correct’ and ‘incorrect’ in relation to your hypothesis, as it is unlikely that you can be this certain from a single investigation. Instead, use terms such as ‘supported’, ‘not supported’, ‘indicated’ and ‘suggested’.

<!-- Make a list of common errors (so can memorise some) -->

good example of a suggestion (high scoring in year 9):

Another error is that the ramp was not placed at exactly the same angle as stated. The protractor app on a phone rounds the angle to the nearest integer. This resulted in a slightly varying acceleration to the theoretical acceleration due to the angle input of the formula being exactly the angle stated in the table. For example, whilst the angle used for the 35° theoretical acceleration was exactly 35°, the actual angle may have been slightly off (eg 34.6°). More advanced angle  measurement tools or software would be required to more accurately measure the angle of decline of the ramp such as a digital level or gauge inclinometer.
