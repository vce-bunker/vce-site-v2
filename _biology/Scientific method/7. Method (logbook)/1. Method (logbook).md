Rubric

The method is: Clear; Repeatable; Includes diagrams that are correctly labelled (if applicable)

The method is presented in steps with each step relating to one instruction. It is clear and able to be repeated. 

Written in third person and past tense. Don’t use “we” etc.
say eg “the button was clicked” instead of click the button

➡️you should have included any of this information in your method, as discussed in class
you needed to specify the angles you tested (rather than “An angle was chosen between 0 to 40 degrees”)

- should be reliable (good experimental design) and reproduceable (good method)
- as large a sample size as possible
- don’t write “setup steps”, include it in methodology

Numbered steps
One instruction per step
Do not need steps for setting up sparkvue
“set up equipment according to diagram below”. (LABELED SETUP PHOTO)
Can’t use the one in the sheet
-repeat steps x-y two MORE times
“repeat steps x-z for a, b, c, d, e angles.
Needs to be a stepfor what data you record (not the actual numbers)

Do not need to include any "software usage tutorial"
