A detailed introduction which provides a detailed overview of the
- investigation purpose
- background information or concepts related to the investigation
- relevant definitions that link to the relevant theory
---

- Explanation or reason for undertaking the investigation. Includes some background information & research on the topic under investigation

define key terms, [talk about plant you are using]
discuss past research
end- therefore it is hypothesized that...

- observe and identify a problem
- form a hypothesis
- develop an iv and a dv

- first part (explaining concept behind experiment) is basically like a normal test short answer question
- make sure about the actual experiment, specific to the experiment

Reword these below to any experiment

- talk about osmosis in plants
- inside of plant cells tharee is a concentration of salt and sugar solution and what is going to happen in these _ tonic solutions and why that ersiults in a change of mass ad what you think will happen
- what are you cnanging and what effect it is going to have on osmosis and the mass of the vegetable
- if working with sugar or salt
- whst osmosis
- how it affect the cells testing
- why the mass changing
- whaty you are going to expect to see in experiment

Past examples:
