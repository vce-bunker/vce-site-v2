polypeptide chain must fold into the protein's shape.

4 levels of structure organisation

# 1
**Primary Structure:**

- The order of amino acids (in polypeptide chain)
- Formed by **covalent peptide bonds** between the amine and carboxyl groups of _adjacent_ amino acids

# 2
**Secondary Structure**
- Folding and coiling in _repeating arrangement_ to form α-helix or β-pleated sheet (polypeptide chains)
- Caused by _**hydrogen bonds** between the amine and carboxyl groups of _non-adjacent_ amino acids
- Random coils- sequences that connect between 2 of these structures
- In pictures, alpha helix- represented as spiral, beta-pleated sheet as arrows

# 3
**Tertiary Structure**

- Polypeptide chain coils and turns to form a complex (3D) shape 
- Caused by _bonds between R groups_; including **hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds**, ionic bonds and hydrophobic interactions
	- disfulfide bonds between cystine
	- ionic and hydrogen bonds between r groups
	- if enzyme mention active site
- Relative amino acid positions are important (e.g. non-polar amino acids usually avoid exposure to aqueous solutions)
- May be important for the function of the protein (e.g. specificity of active site in enzymes)

# 4
**Quaternary Structure**

Proteins possess a 4th level if it
- consists of **more than one polypeptide chain**
- or includes **prosthetic groups**

eg haemoglobin (an oxygen carrying molecule in red blood cells)
- four polypeptide chains (two alpha and two beta)
- iron containing *haem prosthetic groups*

Prosthetic group- inorganic compound involved in protein structure or function
