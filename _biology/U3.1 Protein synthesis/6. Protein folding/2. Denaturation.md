Because the way a protein folds determines its function, any change tertiary structure (3D conformational shape) will alter its activity

Denaturation*- structural change in a protein that results in the loss (usually permanent) of its biological properties
- Usually caused by two key conditions – temperature and pH  (will learn more about this in cellresp/photosynthesis topic)

**pH**
- Amino acids are zwitterions (neutral molecules possessing both negatively (COO–) and positively (NH3+) charged regions)
- Changing the pH will alter the charge of the protein, which will alter its solubility and shape
- optimal pH is based on environment (e.g. stomach- low pH)


**Temperature**
- Too much thermal energy could disrupt the hydrogen bonds which stops protein from functioning as intended
- Temperatures at which proteins denature may vary, but most human proteins function optimally at body temperature (~37ºC)

Changes the structure of the proetins by **breaking the interactions between the R groups (secondary structure)**
