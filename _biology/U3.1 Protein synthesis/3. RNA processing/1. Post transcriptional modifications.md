***(eukaryotic cells only)***

Helps the strand's nuclear export and facilitates its recognition by ribosomes.
Occurs in the nucleus.
### Splicing
In eukaryotic cells, RNA transcripts have introns, so they must be removed in order to form mature messenger RNA (mRNA). This helps its nuclear export and helps ribosomes recognise it

Introns (think interruptions)- non-coding sequences that are removed when forming mature RNA
- When introns are removed, exons are fused together to form a continuous sequence that can then be translated
- The process by which introns are removed is called **splicing** (prokaryotic genes do not have introns and so do not require splicing)  (done by spliceosome)

**Alternative splicing** (alternative to RNA processing) can also remove exons – allows forming different polypeptides from a single gene sequence
- For example, a particular protein may be membrane-bound or cytosolic depending on the presence of an anchoring motif
- There will be multiple different exons, and multiple different proteins can be created by changing which exons are removed

### Other modifications
- **Methyl Cap:** added to the 5’-end to protect against degredation by exonuclease + improves stability, helping it bind to the ribosome
- **Poly-A-tail:** added to the 3’-end to protect against degredation by exonuclease + facilitate its export from the nucleus + improves stability (tail = at the end, smaller num)
