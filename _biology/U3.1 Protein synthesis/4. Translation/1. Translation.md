the process of protein synthesis in which the mRNA prints a sequence of amino acids
1. ribosome binds to mRNA
2. tRNA connect to each codon (and have a amino acid, which detaches)
3. ribosomes catalyse the formation of peptide bonds between each amino acid (via condensation polymerisation reactions)
4. Ribosome moves along the mRNA until it reaches a stop codon, then the polypeptide chain is released (and can fold into a functional protein)
multiple ribosomes can translate an mRNA transcript simultaneously (this group of ribosomes is called a polysome)

Limitations of model of protein synthesis + solution
- Overly simplified, does not account for protein folding, gene regulation or alternative splicing  
- One model cannot explain different types of protein synthesis, prokaryotes/eukaryotes  
- solutions, have more than one model, have more detailed descriptions included
