Bio unit 3 Aos 1 Genetics section
Y11T1A
- Nucleic acids as information molecules that encode instructions for the synthesis of proteins 
- The structure of DNA, the three main forms of RNA (mRNA, rRNA and tRNA) and a comparison of their respective nucleotides
- The genetic code as a universal triplet code that is degenerate and the steps in gene expression, including transcription, RNA processing in eukaryotic cells and translation by ribosomes
- The structure of genes: exons, introns and promoter and operator regions
- The basic elements of gene regulation: prokaryotic _trp_ operon as a simplified example of a regulatory process
- Amino acids as the monomers of a polypeptide chain and the resultant hierarchical levels of structure that give rise to a functional protein
- Proteins as a diverse group of molecules that collectively make an organism’s proteome, including enzymes as catalysts in biochemical pathways
- The role of rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and associated vesicles in the export of proteins from a cell via the protein secretory pathway

*note: much of this unit I learnt using [bioninja](https://vce.bioninja.com.au/) because I hadn't started bio 3/4 at the time. So my notes for this unit are highly based on the site.*

Eukaryote path summary
1. Parts of the dna
2. the dna is transcribed to rna
3. the mrna is matured
4. translated using proteins + other rnas
5. formation of polypeptide chain + covanlent bonding
6. folding into a protein- levels of structure organisation
7. protein destinations

Sac notes
there wil be some easy quesions, there will be some hard questions
there will be an article, article will be given before the sac
