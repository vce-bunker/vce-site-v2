**Key Knowledge:**  
* Amino acids- polypeptide chain monomer
* things that it makes which make a protein

***Overview***

proteins (polypeptides but specified function) are made up of/monomer is amino acids

proteomes is full set of proteins in cell

polypeptide chain (adjacent connected) -> fold into repeating pattern (a helix/beta pleated sheet) (non adjacent connected) -> coils into 3d shape -> connect multiple (if multiple polypeptide chain or has inorganic prosthetic groups)

denaturation- change to the structure which alters activity

**Important don't know hard stuff**

inorganic prosthetic groups
amine group, carboxyl group
hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds, ionic bonds and hydrophobic interactions
