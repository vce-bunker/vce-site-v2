**Proteins**
* diverse group of molecules that collectively make an organism’s proteome, carry out genetic instructions in cell

**Proteome**
- proteome- the complete set of proteins produced by an organism at a given time (1 mark)

Proteome is more than number of genes because:
- Gene sequences may be alternatively spliced following transcription to generate multiple protein variants from a single gene
- Proteins may be modified following translation to promote further variations
- can also vary between cell type, developmental stage and environmental conditions

**Proteomics**
Study of proteins

- **Fibrous** proteins
	- composed of long, narrow strands 
	- insoluble in water
	- _structural_ role
- **Globular** proteins
	- compact and rounded shape
	- soluble in water 
	- _functional_ role


Roles that proteins play
- **Transport** – e.g. haemoglobin
- **Hormones** – e.g. insulin, glucagon
- **Enzymes** – e.g. Rubisco, pep carboxylase
- **Immunity** – e.g. immunoglobulins
- **Sensation** – e.g. rhodopsin
- **Movement** – e.g. actin, myosin
- **Structure** – e.g. collagen, spider silk
for types of enzymes know one example for each

enzyme- biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by lowering activation energy required for a reaction to commence
(and providing an alternative reaction pathway)
