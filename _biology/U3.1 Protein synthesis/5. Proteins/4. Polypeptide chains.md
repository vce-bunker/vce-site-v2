**Polypeptides** (polymer of amino acids)
Long chains of covalently bonded amino acids
Dipeptide- just 2 amino acids connected
Proteins- polypeptides w/ distinct shape and function


Use water to reverse/break down polypeptide into amino acids- Hydrolysis reaction

---
Amino acids can be **covalently bonded** through (another) **condensation polymerisation** reaction to form a **peptide bond** (water produced as byproduct)
Peptide bonds are formed between the amine group (NH2) and carboxylic acid group (COOH) of adjacent amino acids
- The amine group loses a hydrogen (H) and the carboxylic acid loses a hydroxyl (OH): these combine to form water (H2O) as a byproduct
