Protein synthesis occurs at:
- Free ribosomes: proteins used in the cell (intracellular)
- Ribosomes bound to rough ER: proteins for external use (extracellular)

Protein secretion:
- Polypeptides synthesised in rough ER are packaged into a _vesicle_ and sent to Golgi apparatus
- Golgi- packages proteins. immediately secreted or stored for a delayed release (regulatory secretion). Also can add or remove chemical groups
- Proteins are then either released into cytoplasm or packaged into vesicles for exocytosis (secretion)
