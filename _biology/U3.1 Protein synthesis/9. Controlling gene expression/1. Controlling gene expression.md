**Key Knowledge:**  
The basic elements of gene regulation: prokaryotic trp operon as a simplified example of a regulatory process

***Overview***

Basically, the way a prokaryotic cell bases enzyme production rate on the amount of its effect currently in the cell
- transcription factors
	- promote/prevent transcription
- Attenuation
	- The delay in receiving tryptophan causes an early pull which does not detach the RNA, continuing transcription

**Important don't know hard stuff**
attenuation
promoter->operator->leader sequence, attenuator -> operon
eukaryotes-promoter -> introns/exons

**Types of genes**
- Structural- codes for proteins that contribute to the structure or function of the cell (everything except transcription factor)
- Regulatory- codes for transcription factors (aka regulatory proteins) (these are a bit upstream from the gene it regulates)

**importance of gene regulation** (vcaa question)
allows organisms to prevent the unnecessary production of gene products (eg proteins) when they are not required which saves energy
Also ensures that cells produce the appropriate proteins. For example, even though every somatic cell is genetically identical, not all cells express the same genes. For example, skin cells express and produce different proteins to heart cells
