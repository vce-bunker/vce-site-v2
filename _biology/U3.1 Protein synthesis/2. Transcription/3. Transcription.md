The process by which an RNA sequence is produced from a DNA template
1. ***RNA polymerase* binds to the promoter** and triggers unwinding and separation of the DNA strands
2. Free RNA nucleotides will align opposite their complementary base partner
3. RNA polymerase moves along coding sequence and covalently joins the RNA nucleotides together
4. At the terminator, RNA polymerase and the newly formed RNA strand both detach from the DNA template, and the DNA rewinds
5. Many RNA polymerase enzymes can transcribe a DNA sequence sequentially, producing a large number of transcripts

fun fact: Enzyme *reverse transcriptase* can convert RNA to DNA

**Proper question response**
just remember this:
1. rna polymerase **attaches** to **upstream** **promotor**
2. moves along and unzips + reads dna template strand
3. Nucleotides joined together by complementary base pairing (complementary RNA nucleotides) (condensation polymerisation) to produce pre-mRNA.

4. pre mRNA is formed, complementary to the DNA template strand and has U instead of T
5. RNA polymerase and pre mRNA detaches at the terminator

**in a transcription question need to say:**
- rna polymerase
- template strande
- 3'-5'
- 5' to 3'
- complementary strand
