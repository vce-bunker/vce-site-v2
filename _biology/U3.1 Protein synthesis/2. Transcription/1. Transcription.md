**Key Knowledge:**  
- Gene structure: exons, introns and promoter and operator regions
- Genetic code- **universal, triplet** code that is **degenerate** (redundant)
- Gene expression steps: transcription, RNA processing in eukaryotic cells and translation by ribosomes
- The role of rough ER, Golgi apparatus and associated vesicles in protein exporting from a cell via protein secretory pathway

**Important don't know hard stuff**

-transport vesicle
-secretory vesicle
-chemical groups (golgi)
