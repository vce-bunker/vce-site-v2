Assessment on May 29, 2024

Powerpoint reference: Topic 5 - Transport Across the Plasma Membrane Unit 1 & 2 Biology 2024

Key knowledge

- the structure and function of the plasma membrane in the passage of water, hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances via osmosis, facilitated diffusion and active transport
- surface area to volume ratio as an important factor in the limitations of cell size and the need for internal compartments (organelles) with specific cellular functions

Test:
20 questions
what substance is passed through different parts of the membrane and how
end/exocytosis
passive & active transport
surface area to volume ratio
