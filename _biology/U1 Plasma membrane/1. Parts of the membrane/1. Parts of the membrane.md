The barrier surrounding a cell; the cell membrane

Its job is to regulate these in the cell:

- temperature
- concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide
- ph (potential of hydrogen)
- concentration of salts/ions

There are various ways that molecules can travel through the membrane.

This is really important, it **allows nutrients to come in** and **unwanted stuff to go out**.
