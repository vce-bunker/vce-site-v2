### DNA manipulation techniques and applications
- The use of enzymes to manipulate DNA, including polymerase to synthesise DNA, ligase to join DNA and endonucleases to cut DNA
- The function of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria and the application of this function in editing an organism’s genome
- Amplification of DNA using polymerase chain reaction
- The use of gel electrophoresis in sorting DNA fragments, including the interpretation of gel runs for DNA profiling
- The use of recombinant plasmids as vectors to transform bacterial cells as demonstrated by the production of human insulin
- The use of genetically modified and transgenic organisms in agriculture to increase crop productivity and to provide resistance to disease

## Biotechnological applications of biochemical pathways
- Potential uses and applications of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies to improve photosynthetic efficiencies and crop yields
