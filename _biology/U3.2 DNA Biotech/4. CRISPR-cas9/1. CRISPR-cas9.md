**Key Knowledge:**  
- The function of CRISPR-Cas9 in bacteria and the application of this function in editing an organism’s genome

- Potential uses and applications of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies to improve photosynthetic efficiencies and crop yields


basically the steps involved in crispr cas 9 system
and that gene editing inserts an artificial rna

***Overview***

1. The crispr locus stores dna from viruses
2. an rna is created complementary to a thing in the crispr locus and sticks to a cas9 endonuclease
3. when a virus inserts its dna the rna sticks to it because it is complementary which causes the endonuclease to cut (destroy) the dna

CRISPR allows scientists to cut DNA at a location of their choosing; for example, in a recombinant plasmid to insert a foreign gene, or to remove a segment of DNA (any suitable example may be accepted here).  

**Describe how CRISPR Cas9 is better than old genome editing tools** (vcaa)
*Cheaper*  
- study design: "easy and cost effective way of editing an organism's genome"

*More Efficient*
*More Precise* - high specificity- exact locations in genome, minimize off-target effects (which were common with older tools).  
- why crispr is precise (because got target gene) (note that say accurate for sticky ends, nor precision)

*Programmable* - Programmed to target any sequence, whereas older tools require specialised engineering
- Advantage over restriction enzymes: Allows us to cut DNA at any sequence of our choosing, rather than being restricted to the set recognition sites of restriction enzymes that have been sourced from bacteria.

Don't need to know examples of traditional crispr variations

**Biological considerations for the use of CRISPR Cas9 to edit genomes in animals**
*Justice* - concerns over the expenses and whether everyone will have access  
*Beneficence* - maximising benefits, reducing cat allergies for example  
*Non-maleficence* - ensuring that any editing does not harm animals  
*Integrity* - honest and unbiased reporting of all data and results of genome editing regardless of positive or negative outcomes
