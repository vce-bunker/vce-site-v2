**Key Knowledge:**  
- Use of the 4 enzymes in manipulating DNA

- **Enzymes:** Polymerase (copy DNA), endonuclease (cuts DNA), ligase (paste/joins DNA)

**Enzymes**
Class of proteins that catalyse chemical reactions (enabling them to proceed under favourable conditions)

Extra definitions (combine)
Polymerase
synthesise new complementary strand of DNA during  by joining free floating nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction  

Endonuclease
cut the **double stranded** DNA of the target gene/plasmid

Ligase
catalyses joining by covalent phosphodiester bonds
- ligase connects the phosphodiester bonds but the sticky ends auto join the hydrogen bonds

Reverse transcriptase
uses mRNA transcript to synthesise complementary strand of cDNA with thymine replacing uracil

---

Sticky ends
- *overhanging base pairs* (must say this)

EcoRI (endonuclease example)
Eco = e coli
R = strain
I  =1 in roman numerals (1 because it was the 1st e coli restriction enzyme to be discovered)
