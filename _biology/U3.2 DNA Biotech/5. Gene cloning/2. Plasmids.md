### Vectors
a vector is a self-replicating vehicle (e.g. plasmid or viral DNA) used to transfer a desired gene of interest into a foreign cell/organism
- able to replicate inside host organism (thus bacterial plasmids are commonly used)
- have recognition sites that can be cut by endonucleases
- can have a genetic marker (eg antibiotic resistance)
- small (easier to uptake into cell)
- easy to manipulate
	- may be modified for further functionality (eg selection markers, reporter genes, see image next page)

### Plasmid features
- circular dna found in bacteria separate to chromosomal dna
- bacteria can carry multiple plasmids
- self replicated independent of the chromosomal dna replication
recombinant plasmid- plasmids that carry foreign DNA

**Plasmid features**
ORI (origin of replication)  
Section of DNA which is recognised by a cells DNA replication proteins allowing for DNA synthesis to begin  
  
Antibiotic resistance gene  
natural, seletable marker gene, allows bacteria to be selected from those without the marker by exposure to antibiotics  
  
MCS (multiple cloning site)  
Region within a plasmid containing multiple unique endonuclease cut sites  
  
Promoter region  
Controls the binding of RNA polymerase, upstream of target genes, required for gene expression  

Reporter gene
makes products that attach to the protein to enable detection
- eg in insulin: b galactosidase
allows for detection of successful gene insertion
  



### Markers
**Selectable marker**  
Allows for determining that bacteria have taken up the plasmid  
e.g. Ampicillin resistance gene or GFP gene (glow)
- those that survive the antibiotic (or glow) contain plasmids
  
**Screening marker**  
Allows for determining that the plasmid is recombinant
E.g. LacZ gene (codes for beta galactosidase enzyme)
- placed next to the inserted gene of interest (fusion protein)
- beta galactosidase converts X-gal to a blue product
- bacteria are grown on agar plates with X-gal, the ones that have beta galactosidase (and therefore the gene of interest) will turn blue

Tetracycline gene
- gene of interest is placed inside tet resistance gene
- those with gene of interest will not grow in tetracycline

**Example of markers**
dna can be inserted to interrupt another gene.
THis makes the gene no longer function. THis can act as a marker as we can filter out the ones that cannot function thaat gene (the ones that have the new dna inserted).

another scenario is when the new dna (new gene) does not interrupt any other gene. in this case antibiotic resistance is used

1. the new gene is put inside an existing antibiotic gene (tetracycline)
2. a new antibiotic gene is also added to the plasmid (ampicillin)
3. The plasmids are added to bacteria
4. the bacteria that **have the plasmid** and **its plasmid has the new gene** will:
	1. have ampicillin
	2. have no tetracycline
	(allowing them to be filtered)
	 (specific antibiotics here are for insulin)
