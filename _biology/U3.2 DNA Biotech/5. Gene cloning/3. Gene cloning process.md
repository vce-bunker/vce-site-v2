### 1. Isolation of a gene of interest and a vector (gene delivery vehicle)

The dna is isolated from cells by centrifugation (heavier components such as nuclei are separated) and then precipitation

**Methods for a scientist to obtain copies of a gene**
- cut + isolate gene w/ gene probes
- DNA synthesizers, known sequence, PCR (using primers that specifically target the gene sequence)
- mRNA + reverse transcriptase (therefore lacking introns allowing bacteria to use them)
### 2. Insertion of the gene of interest into the vector (via digestion and ligation)

Digestion- Both the gene of interest and plasmid are cut with specific endonucleases, with blunt ends or 2 different endonucleases that detect a recognition site(sticky end) to ensure the gene is inserted in the correct direction

The digested gene of interest and plasmid are then fused together to form a recombinant plasmid

DNA ligase joins the vector and gene by fusing their sugar-phosphate backbones with a covalent phosphodiester bond

Gel electrophoresis separates the recombinant plasmids from the non modified plasmids

### 3. Integration of the recombinant vector into a host cell (and subsequent gene expression)

methods of introducing the recombinant plasmid include heat shocking, electroporation or liposomes

Antibiotic resistance gene can also be added in the plasmid vector so that they can filter out which cells have been modified (transgenic)

## Vcaa questions
**Describe the process of making a recombinant plasmid** (what to memorize)
1. gene of interest is isolated (eg insulin chain A and B), plamid vector obtained  
2. Same endonuclease cleaves the plasmid and [gene of interest], producing complementary sticky ends  
3. Plasmid and gene of interest are mixed, hydrogen bonds form between the complementary sticky ends, plasmid and gene anneal 
4. DNA ligase added forms covalent phosphodiester bonds in sugar phosphate backbone, forming recombinant plasmid

**List the process of bacterial transformation** (what to memorize)
1. heat shock/electroporation (A and B chains into separate bacteria)  
2. Bacteria are grown on agar plates (selective media), through selectable and screening markers (examples), isolate bacteria with desired genes
3. Gene of interest expressed - [protein/chains] produced  
4. Bacteria lysed to harvest and purify [protein/chains], {Insulin chains joined to form functional human insulin}

**Recombinant plasmids can be used to artificially create insulin. Briefly describe the steps in creating artificial insulin using bacteria, including the roles of restriction enzymes, plasmids,**  
**DNA ligase and antibiotics.**
5 marks:
• Insulin gene isolated + cut w/ restriction enzymes -> 
complementary sticky ends
• Plasmid vector cut w/ same restriction enzyme, DNA ligase seals insulin gene into plasmid -> recombinant plasmid
• Plasmid is incorporated into bacterial cells using a process such as heat shock or electroporation.  
• The bacteria then grown on an agar plate w/ antibiotic.  
Only bacteria with the recombinant plasmid (which  
contains antibiotic resistance gene) survive, allowing for  
separation from non-transformed bacteria
• Successfully transformed bacteria express the insulin gene and so produce the human insulin protein, which is extracted and purified.

when the insulin genes are inserted into their respective plasmids, they are inserted next to a gene for b-galactosidase protein, which alows for detection of successful gene insertion.

pglo ethic
- not respect becaus  you are doing it to bacteria not animals. only need consent from
- adhering to inrtrinsic value in heir life

- ethical proce
- disadvantages 


- justice for insulin- unequal access to treatment
