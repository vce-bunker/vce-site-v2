**Key Knowledge:**  
- Polymerase chain reaction to amplify DNA

**Polymerase Chain Reaction** (PCR, but say full name in questions)
Artificial method of replicating a specific DNA sequence under laboratory conditions   (this is what is done for covid testing)
- Each reaction doubles the DNA, done about 25 times
- reaction occurs in a thermal cylinder

**Taq polymerase**
Enzyme isolated from the thermophilic bacterium _Thermus aquaticus_ (heat tolerating bacteria)
- Optimal temperature is ~75ºC (can function in high temp without denaturing)
- Extends the nucleotide chain from the primers – therefore primers are used to select the sequence to be copied
- primer-short sequence that helps locate a specific part of a genome. Initiates the polymerase transcription

**primers**
short segments of single stranded DNA (don't need to know length)
forward + reverse primers

**Why must RNA be converted to DNA in PCR** (vcaa question)
- Taq acts on DNA

**limitations of pcr**
- foreign dna (contamination)
- you need to know the dna sequence to begin with in order to design the primers
- dna polymerase could cause mutations
