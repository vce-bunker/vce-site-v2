**Key Knowledge:**  
- Gel electrophoresis in separating and sorting DNA fragments, including interpretation of gel runs for DNA profiling

**Gel Electrophoresis**
Separate and isolate DNA fragments based on their mass / size
- Samples of DNA are placed in the wells of an agarose gel and the gel is then submerged in a buffering solution
- Electric current applied, causes samples to move through the gel towards the positive side (as DNA is negatively charged from phosphate groups)
- Smaller fragments are less slowed by the gel so will move faster and further

**dna profiling**
STR's (repeating dna patterns) exist in non coding regions of the genome
- these vary in length between each individual (these are what are cut and put in the gel electrophoresis)

**Define Short tandem repeats**
Repeating end to end short DNA sequences found in the introns (in hypervariable region of DNA), different individuals will have different number of these repeats

how str's are used and why are they useful
- provides users w/ unique dna profile
- inherited across family members so relatives can be used to track down culprit (case study) (unlikely to be in test because the case is not about crime)

**Explain factors that affect how far and how fast fragments move through the gel**
Gel viscosity- *more viscous* = *slower fragment movement* through the porous agarose gel

Voltage - *greater voltage* = *faster movement*  
  
Size - *smaller fragments* = *faster movement* 
  
Charge - DNA is negatively charged due to the *phosphate group*, thus will move towards the *positive electrode*  
  
Duration of time - greater the further
