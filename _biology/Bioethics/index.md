## Bioethics
- the application of moral principles to the field of biological science.

---

ethics- principles of acceptable and moral conduct determining what is ‘right’ and what is ‘wrong’

highlighted- teacher says just memorising these key points and saying them in a question is enough of a definition

**General response:
1. some need to refer back to text, or state definition
2. state the definition of the approach/concept
	- need to memorise the definitions**
3. argue from the point of view of the concept, what is is and how it mught relate to the article, and how can it be used to support the point

bioethical issues from different perspectives

when asked to state 3 bioethical considerations, state as many safe ones as possible to maximise chances of 3 of them being the needed answer (even if it says regarding _ approach)

provide number of reasons equal to the number of marks, then justify all (for non approach/concept bioethics questions)
### Biothical approaches

- way to determine the best/right course of action
- way to think when looking at a bioethical issue
- identifies different perspectives before choosing a rational position based on reasoned reflection

Process may be:

Consequence based

- Focus on the outcome rather than the process taken to reach it
- aim to achieve max positive results and min negative results
- The ethical choice would be the one with more positive outcome for more people
- <mark>maximisation of positive outcomes and minimisation of negative effects.</mark>

Duty/rules based

- Focus on idea that people have a duty to act a certain way
- ethical rules must be followed, regardless of consequences
- what ethical rules should be followed on a societal basis
- always do the right thing even if it leads to negative consequences
    - not acceptable to cause immediate or temporary harm in the pursuit of a potential ‘greater good’
- Consequences are irrelevant, it is the actions which should be favoured or are more important.
- eg always wrong to kill and we should never lie
- humans have an obligation to follow these rules or duties and considers the action performed more important the outcome achieved
- <mark>people have a duty to act in a particular ethical way regardless of the consequences.</mark>

Virtues based

- Focus on what the person personally believes, recognising different cultures, backgrounds etc
- values people of morally good character over consequences or actions
- recognises that people of different cultures and backgrounds might be guided or influenced by the same actions in different ways
- focus on the characteristics and behaviours a ‘good' person would seek to achieve to then be able to act in the right way
- considering the morals and virtue of each individual, and ensuring that investigation takes these morals into account
- <mark>based on moral character of the person carrying out the action rather than action.</mark>

A virtues-based approach would take into consideration what type of person you want to be and states you should act how someone with excellent character traits or high virtues would act.

Instead of asking ‘what are the consequences?’ or ‘what rules/duties am I bound to follow?’, while wearing the virtue ethics hat we should ask ‘which action would a good person choose?’

### Bioethical concepts

- applied when considering a position with regards to the ethicalness of an issue. These concepts structire the issue from different angles to allow for parallel thinking processes.
- general guidelines that should be followed during an investigation, helps identify bioethical issues
- help determine how ethical something is by helping to guide analysis
- considered in conjunction with the ethical approaches

Respect

- Consider perspective of the individual and collective
- valuing living things, both human and non-human
    - consideration given to customs, capacity for decision-making, and autonomy.
    - Due regard is given to the welfare, liberty, beliefs, perceptions, customs and cultural heritage of the individual and the collective
- For living things that cannot make decisions, respect ensures they are empowered where possible and protected as necessary.
- <mark>living things have an intrinsic value; giving due regard to the welfare, beliefs and customs others.</mark>

> Respect- Consent:
Animals (excluding humans) have no cognitive capacity to ****consent. When I take my dog to the vet - she does not agree to any treatment. I agree on her behalf.
> 
> 
> With **embryos,** whilst at the zygote stage they also cannot consent **however** will develop into adults who have cognitive capacity to consent/withhold consent to a treatment.
> 
> We will not accept consent for animals, we will accept consent for embryos.

Non-malficence

- Minimising possible harmful steps to make the benefits outweigh the harm
- sources of harm are avoided to the best of a researcher’s knowledge
- <mark>involves avoiding the causations of harm.</mark>

Beneficence

- Prevent harmful steps from creating harm (risks minimised), and maximise benefits
- prevention of harm rather than avoid the causations of harm (non-maleficence)
- <mark>maximising benefits and minimising the risks and harms.</mark>

Integrity

- the committment to searching for knowledge
- Honest and full reporting of findings and sources of information
- <mark>the commitment to the honest reporting of results, whether favourable or unfavourable.</mark>

Justice

- Fair consideration of competing claims, and equal distribution of an action’s benefits for various groups and no burden on particular groups
- <mark>no unfair burden on a particular group.</mark>
