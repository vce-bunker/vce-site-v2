preventative mechanisms of pathogenic infection {in animals and plants}. aims to prevent **entry**

#### Barriers
•Physical barriers: features solid or fluid obstacles that prevent entry of pathogens

•Chemical barrier: features enzymes, toxins and acids to inhibit the growth or development of pathogens and/or act to destroy pathogens.

•Microbiological barrier: the presence of normal flora to prevent the growth or colonisation of microorganisms that may be pathogenic.

Spines, thorns etc, usually only deter animals/predators, rather than pathogens. Take note of the context of the question.

breach physical barrier (intact skin) by entering body through openings in body eg nose or mouth
