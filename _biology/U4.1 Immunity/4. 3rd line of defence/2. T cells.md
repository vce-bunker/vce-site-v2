##### Helper T Cells
- *initiates adaptive immunity* (mention this where possible)
- binds to complementary antigen-MHC II complexes (on APC's)

Once binded:
- Clonal selection + expansion into Effector T cells and memory Tc cells (which clonally expand into Th cells upon reexposure to antigen)
###### Cytokine release (effector T cells)
- release cytokines
- Activates matching B cells (humoral), and cytotoxic T cells (cell mediated)
- Activates phagocytes 


##### Cytotoxic T Cells
- (cell-mediated immunity)
1. immature cytotoxic T cells stimulated by cytokines released by Th cells
2. immature cytotoxic t cells binds to complementary abnormal mhc I marker on **infected self cells** (but don't cause apoptosis)
3. it will do clonal selection and expansion into activated cytotoxic T cells and memory Tc cells

In mature:
1. perforin creates pores in plasma membrane
2. granzymes travel through the pores and initiate apoptosis
3. infection- virus infects respiratory cells

Memory tc cells
- when recognising complementary antigen will do clonal expansion into Tc cells
