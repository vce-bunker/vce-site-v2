**Lymphatic system**
transport network that monitors the body for signs of infection and carry out a response

does not exist in plants

**Role of the lymphatic system**
Storing memory cells and B and T lymphocytes,  
Transporting antigens to lymph nodes  
Trapping antigens in lymph nodes  
Site of clonal selection and expansion  
Transportation of lymph fluid containing lymphocytes, antibodies and immune cells around body
### Primary lymphoid organs
Bone marrow
- Cells of the immune system are made here from stem cells
- B Lymphocytes mature here
- B for bone marrow

Thymus
- T cells mature here
- T for thymus

### Secondary lymphoid organs

Lymph node
- Pathogens, antigen fragments, APCs and lymphocytes transported here for the adaptive immune response to occur
- Foreign antigens meet and activate B and T cells here
- Swell when infection occurs due to production of more lymphocytes
- site of adaptive immune response

Spleen
- Behind the stomach in humans
- **Filters blood for pathogens**
- Contains T and B cells
- Contains macrophages and dendritic cells

Tonsils

Lymph
- flows through the lymphatic system which is controlled by muscle contractions and valves to ensure that the lymph flows in one direction.
- returns to blood then back to lymph nodes (repeat)


**State the role played by the lymphatic system in an immune response** (vcaa question)
presentation of antigen of the mhc2 markers on Th cells
lymph fluids, lymph nodes
macrophages
t cells, b cells congregate
(these are separate possible answers)
