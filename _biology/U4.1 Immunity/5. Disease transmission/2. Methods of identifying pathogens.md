##### Methods of identifying pathogens
-  **Physical**: Determine bacteria structure through microscope
-  **Phenotypic**: Grow and test/identify bacteria through agar & chemical reactions
-  **Immunological**: Detect presence of antibodies or antigens (e.g. ELISA)
-  **Molecular**: Check genes with hybridisation or genome sequencing


##### Elisa
Sandwich method
- antibodies that are fixed to a plate trap specific antigens (that are placed in as serum sample after)
- Following this, detection antibodies (linked to colour changing enzymes) are added to provide positive identification

Highly sensitive and accurate

Direct
- antigen, then labeled antibody (less sensitive and accurate than sandwich)

Indirect method
- antigen, then antibody from serum, then a labelled antibody
- detects presence of antibody

Note: if there is a question on eliza they will provide context about it so don't need to actually know

9. Compare the role of primary and secondary antibodies in ELISA.
Primary antibodies target the antigen of interest (1)  
Secondary antibodies target the primary antibody (1) and assists pathogen detection (1)
