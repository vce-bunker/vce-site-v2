#### Inflammatory response
four symptoms: pain, redness, heat, and swelling.

Steps in the Inflammatory Response
1. Damage caused by [the pathogen]
2. Damaged cells release cytokines attracting **neutrophils and Mast Cells** (which in turn degranulate and release histamine)
3. Blood vessels dilate to increase blood flow to area (vasodilation)
4. WBC (phagocytes) attracted to the area and destroy foreign objects/bacteria
5. Complement proteins (state function)

Resolvins return the dilated capillaries and vessels back to their original state (1).

**Purpose of inflammatory response:**
alert and recruit immune cells to the site of infection to remove any pathogens present.
