#### Allergens
Allergic reactions are a **malfunction** of the immune system

1. Initial exposure to allergen: makes plasma cells produce IgE antibodies, which attach to complementary receptors on mast cells, priming them
2. Subsequent exposure: the allergens bind to the IgE antibodies on primed mast cells in a process called **cross-linking**.
3. The mast cells release histamines (**degranulation**), triggering an inflammatory response leading to allergy symptoms. (such as inflammation/swelling, rash, sneezing, shortness of breath.) which can vary in severity.
mention "cross linking" - see diagram, triggering the response

**if someone is stung by a wasp for the second time and have a huge allergic response within minutes why?**
allergens from the wasp venom bind to IgE antibodies already bound to mast cells (which have been primed due to a prior exposure), causing degranulation of mast cells releasing histamines which initiate the inflammatory response and lead to allergic reactions
