wbc = leukocytes
**phagocytes** (cell that can do phagocytosis)
- neutrophilis, macrohages, dendritic cells
- contains lysozomes which digest
- digests both pathogens and infected cells

**APC** (antigen presenting cells)
- Macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells
- displays antigens on **MHC II**
Travel to lymph nodes
- present to T helper cells

---
##### Macrophages (guard cells) + Dendritic Cell
Phagocytosis
cytokine release
APC
##### Neutrophils
- Toxin release
- Does phagocytosis but not APC
- Release cytokines
- Dies in less than a day (they are too op so this needs to happen)
**Analogy:**  Standard police officer – quick to respond to the situation, but lacks special training or skills and so dies rapidly

**Mast Cells**
Initiate **inflammatory responses** by degranulating, releasing histamine (increase blood vessel dilation and permeability)

**Eosinophils**
- contains granules with cytotoxic chemicals which perforate cell membranes
- helps defend from pathogens too large to be phagocytosed, eg parasites

**Natural Killer (NK) Cells**
- Target tumor, virally infected and transplanted cells (i.e. they target ’self’ tissue (missing MHC1 marker))
- release perforins and granzymes which triggers apoptosis
- They are a type of lymphocyte and have a comparable role to cytotoxic T cells, except that they are non-specific
- NK cells are recruited to sites of infection when the infected cells release a specific chemical agent (cytokine) called interferon
- **Analogy:**  Bomb disposal technician – functions to remove suspicious or compromised cells from within the body

How self recognition works:
MHC I marker - found on surface of all nucleated (has a nucleus) cells (other than RBC's) (basically all body cells, note not on pathogens)
MHC II marker - found on surface of specialised cells
- eg macrophages, B lymphocytes and dendritic cells

Immune cells constantly scan for non self cells (they have non self receptors on them), which triggers an immune response
