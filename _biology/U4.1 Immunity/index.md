**Responding to antigens-kk7**

- <mark>physical, chemical and microbiota barriers</mark>

- the innate immune response including:
	- <mark>steps in an inflammatory response</mark>
	- <mark>characteristics and roles of</mark> macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, eosinophils, natural killer cells, mast cells, complement proteins and interferons
- <mark>initiation of an immune response</mark>, including:
	- antigen presentation
	- distinction between self-antigens and non-self antigens
	- cellular and non-cellular pathogens
	- allergens


**Acquiring immunity-kk8**

- the role of the lymphatic system in the immune response as a <mark>transport network</mark> and the role of lymph nodes as <mark>sites for antigen recognition by T and B lymphocytes</mark>

- the characteristics and roles of the components of the adaptive immune response against both extracellular and intracellular threats, including the actions of B lymphocytes and their antibodies, helper T and cytotoxic T cells

- the difference between natural and artificial immunity and active and passive strategies for acquiring immunity

**Disease challenges and strategies kk9** (just some definitions and examples for this kk.)

- <mark>scientific and social strategies</mark> employed to identify and control the spread of pathogens, including:
	- identification of the pathogen and host
	- modes of transmission
	- measures to control transmission

• vaccination programs and their role in maintaining herd immunity

• the development of immunotherapy strategies, including the use of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. (**not in the sac**)

• the emergence of new pathogens and re-emergence of known pathogens in a globally connected world, including the impact of European arrival on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples

INNATE
- **non specific**
- No-memory
- includes 1st and 2nd line of defence

ADAPTIVE (not born with it)
- **specific**
- also called acquired
- includes passive and active
- 3rd line of defence

active - **the body’s immune system must respond to** **the antigens of the vaccine and develop its own antibodies and memory cells.**
live attenuted can replicate

if it is a case study make sure you relate it to the case, relate to data if possible (make sure it is relevant to case study)
must adapt your memorised answer 


activate-
destroy- wrap up with what is it that destroys
key term- antigen binding sites etc


will be rarely asked for examples unless the concept is mainly memorising examples. because then they won't be able to give you a question based on a given case

mention mhc 1 and 2 wherever possible
