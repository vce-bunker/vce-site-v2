I didn't do biology when they were teaching this unit- below is some very brief notes

Things that will need to know

- Mitosis
    - At what stage in the cell syscle the GI checkpoint is located and decribe the purpose of this checkpoint

Binary fission, meiosis, conjugation

Mitosis

- Subphases
- Micrograph
- In which stage are most cells?

Apoptosis

- Steps and causes
- In/extrinstic (similarities and differences)

Necrosis

DNA, cell cycle
parts

Eukaryotic vs
prokaryotic

Note

In the nucles of cell

Nucleolus

- Where ribosomes are formed

Chromatin

- Contains dna and proteins

~~Prokaryotic~~

- ~~No nucleus or membrane bound organelles~~
- ~~Circular dna is found in the form of a nucleiud within the cytosol~~
- ~~Ribosomes are also found ni the cytosol so the prokaryote can express its own proteins~~

Cell cycle, mitosis

Dna, meiosis

Binary fission

- Prokaryotes use binary fission to reproduce.
- It splits into 2 gentically identical copies of itself
- The dna and plasmids are replicated
- Cytokinesis- the splitting of the cell, a bulge inwards in the middle is a septum. New cell wall formed between

**Eukaryotic Cell cycle**

1. Interphase

Longest stage

creation of dna, proteins and organelles

1. Mitosis (division of nucleus)

Prophase
(prepare)- chromosomes condense and become visible

Metaphase
(middle)- chromosomes line up in middle of cell

Anaphase
(away)- sister chromatids separate and move away from each other

Telophase
(two)- nuclear membrane reforms around the 2 sets of chromosomes on either side
of the cell

1. Cytokinesis

Splitting
of the cell into 2 daughter cells, bulge inwards

DNA,

Meiosis

- Same process as the thing above(no. 2 and 3) (interphase- meiosis 1- meiosis 2)
- Meiosis 2- after they are splitted from 1 to 2, they are further splitted

Monosomy - missing chromosome (2n - 1)

Trisomy - extra chromosome (2n + 1)
