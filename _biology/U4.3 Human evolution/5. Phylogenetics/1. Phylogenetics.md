- which organisms it evolved to or from
- which species more closely related


#### Phylogenetic trees
diagrams used to show evolutionary relationships among organisms
- (evolutionary past) constructed using:
	- morphology
	- molecular homology
	- DNA hybridisation

Taxon (taxa)
- biological classification of organisms
- arranged in hierarchial rank from kingdom to species (don't need to know this)
- members of a taxon share morphological characteristics
