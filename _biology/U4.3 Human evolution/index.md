## Evolution
- **permanent change in gene(allele) frequencies in population of individuals.**

Microevolution
- small-scale changes within gene pools over generations.

Macroevolution
- large scale changes in form, as viewed in the fossil record, involving whole groups of species and genera.

**Why is it so challenging to confidently and conclusively identify and categorise archaic hominin species?**
1. *Fossil record incomplete - many species may be missing,*  
2. *many fossils are incomplete (only small part like finger bone)- difficult to compare physical features and determine clear differences between species'*  
3. *closely related homo species may not show great differences in physical structure*  
4. different researches with same information may interpret fossil traits and relationships differently  
5. *Significant variation between fossil speciments - can blur boundaries between different species + lead to disagreements among researches*  
6. Evidence of interbreeding between
7. *New fossil discoveries are made which often alter previous views or ideas*
