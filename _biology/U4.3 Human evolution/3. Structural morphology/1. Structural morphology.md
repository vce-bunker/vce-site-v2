 the study of comparing similarities in *physical features* between organisms to infer relatedness
- similarities -> shared ancestry
- field of comparing between organisms- comparative morphology

**Homologous structures**
- present in different species
- look or function differently but
- from common ancestor and have similar structure
- eg pendactyl (5 digit forelimb found in most vertebrates - same general bone structure)
- 3 bones in middle ear

- evidence of divergent evolution


**Analogous structures**

- similar functions but different ancestor
- due to similar selection pressures
- eg shark vs whale flippers
- evidence of convergent evolution


not in the study design, only homologous.  
This is for comparison questions to homogous/divergents  


**Vestigal structures**
- degenerate
- lost all or most of their functionality
- no selective pressures to make it disappear
- eg human tailbone
