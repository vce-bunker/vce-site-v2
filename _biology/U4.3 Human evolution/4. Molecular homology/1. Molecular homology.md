The study of comparing similarities in *nucleotide sequences of DNA or amino acid sequences in proteins* between organisms to establish relatedness

The more similar these sequences are, the more closely related two species are (as they have had less time to accumulate mutations or changes in their sequence). 

Molecular homology can show two species are closely related even if their structural morphology is very different.  

##### Conserved genes (basically index genes)
**genes that have remained largely unchanged during evolution, and are found in genomes of many different species**
 - eg rubisco, ATP synthase (essentially ones that changing would be unfavourable)
