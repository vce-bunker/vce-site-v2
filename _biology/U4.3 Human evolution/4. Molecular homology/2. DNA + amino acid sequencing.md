Amino acid sequencing
- degree of similarity - number of mutations that have occurred
	- closer related = more similar sequence
- **differences accumulate more slowly due to degeneracy of DNA CODE**- silent mutations
-  eg haemoglobin and cytochrome c (enzyme in mitochondria)
	- cytochrome c - 
		- encoded by mitochondrial DNA
			- present in most eukaryotic cells (highly conserved protein) **(because essential for aerobic cellular resp)**
		- mitochondrial dna is better than nuclear DNA:
			- mutation rate is higher in mtDNA non coding regions than DNA (no repair mechanisms)
				- can compare closely related
			- enough differences to compare closely related species (but still bad see below)
			- only inherited from mother - no recombination (mixing of DNA with father) (so changes are only due to mutations)
			- mtDNA more likely to be recovered from ancient remains eg teeth or bones less likely to degrade
		- however
			- nuclear DNA has more bases and therefore more info to compare
			- dna from both parents provides evidence of interbreeding
- benefit - quicker and cheaper to run, easier to interpret (less data produced compared to DNA (less amino acids than bases)) - better for comparing more distantly related species
- limitation - closely related would be very similar, cannot identify silent mutations


**how can mtDNA be used to trace ancestry from original hominin ancestors in Africa**
mtDNA can be used to trace ancestry through molecular homology - mtDNA sequencing to find relatedness by comparing mtDNA to ancestors, more similarities indicates a higher degree of relatedness
