### Timeline
- some primates left trees
- bipedalism
	- better vision in grasslands (as africa cooled and dried, became savanna)
	- tool use
	- holding food and offspring
	- energy efficient movement
	- greater airflow across body (thermoregulation)
	- signalling to others


Australopithecus afarensis
--> Homo sapien


#### Skull shape change
- reduced brow ridge
- increased forehead height
- increased brain size
- u shaped jaw -> parabolic shaped
- decreased jaw and teeth size (shift from herbivorous to omnivorous)
- foramen magnum (see above)
- only homo sapiens have chin




 c to s shaped spine (added strength + flexibility)
 funnel to barrel shaped ribcage
more inwardly angled femur for balance on 2 legs
feet
- shorter toes
- larger heel
- larger arch (converts foot into spring improving walking efficiency)
- no opposable big toe 
- opposable thumb

Brain
- increased relative brain size
- development in speech and language comprehension areas

witht ht ange, the knees are angled inwards ,placing feet under body
can't say the femur is angled, can say more inwardly angled femur (or will lose mark in sac)
