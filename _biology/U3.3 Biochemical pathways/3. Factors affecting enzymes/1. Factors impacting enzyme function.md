The general factors that impact on enzyme function in relation to photosynthesis and cellular respiration: **changes in temperature, pH, enzyme and substrate concentration, competitive and non-competitive enzyme inhibitors**

I can:
•explain how changes in temperature affect enzyme function in relation to collisions and structure relating to rate of reaction
•explain how changes in pH affect enzyme function relating to rate of reaction
•explain how enzyme and substrate concentration affect rate of reaction
•describe competitive and non competitive inhibition
•describe reversible and irreversible inhibition
•interpret graphs relating to enzyme function
