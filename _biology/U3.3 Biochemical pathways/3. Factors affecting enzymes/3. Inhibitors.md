competitive inhibitor
- also complementary to active site
- binds to active site so substrate cannot bind

Non competitive inhibirot
- binds to allosteric site and causes a conformational change in the enzyme 
- active site changed so the substrate doesn't bind

always mention the term "active site" if possible
	- eg active site changes shape, substrate no longer complementary (lost affinity) so cannot bind
	- exception if it is non competitive inhibition
