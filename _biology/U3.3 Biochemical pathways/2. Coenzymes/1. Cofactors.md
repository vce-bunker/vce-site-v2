**Coenzymes and cofactors**
Cofactor: a non-protein molecule or ions that are essential for the normal functioning of **some** enzymes

Inorganic cofactors (no carbon)
- metal ions eg magnesium ions, copper ions, calcium ions
Organic cofactor (contains carbon)
- prosthetic group: tightly bound to enzyme allowing it to function

**Coenzyme**
- **type of organic cofactor** that are non-protein molecules that contribute to the activity and stability of enzymes (that is the main focus of SD)
- loosely bind to enzymes when the enzyme is acting on the substrate, to help catalysing reaction
- some can carry protons or electrons
- eg NAD, NADP, ATP, which move groups (such as hydrogen and phosphate) and energy between metabolic pathways in cells (will learn about this later)
