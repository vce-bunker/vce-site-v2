Light dependent reaction (LI) (thylakoid **membranes** 
- light captured, H2O split into H, O and e-
- oxygen released (or used for cellresp)
- produce atp and nadph which go to light independent reaction

**Light independent reaction** (LD)

- atp breaks apart co2
- carbon from co2 forms chains (carbon fixation)
- nadph unloads electrons and H+ (which react with the carbons)
- additional H and O combine to form H2O
- calvin cycle creates product which can be converted into glucose

how photosynthesis could be measured
- measure pH as co2 is acidic (remember ocean acidification)
- put leaf discs underwater, oxygen produced makes the leaf float
