- glucose cannot be used, you need to turn it into atp
- reactions break down compounds into simple compounds and release atp as one of the products
- cellular respiration occurs in all organisms (except archara)

the type of cellular respiration that uses oxygen
because it has oxygen it is able to produce a lot more ATP.


- net yield- 30 **or** 32 atp produced
- glucose broken into c02 and water in the presence of oxygen (which acts as the final electron acceptor in the ETC)
- involves reactions in the cytosol + mitochondria
- all eukaryotic organisms, but not prokaryotic organisms

**Coenzymes**
NAD+ loaded with H+ and e- --> NADH
FADH loaded with H+ and e- --> FADH2
ADP loaded Pi --> ATP

don't need to know really specific details of the biochemical processes
