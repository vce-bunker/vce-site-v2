**Rubisco**
- enzyme
- removes the carbon from co2
- **adds it to a 5 carbon molecule in calvin** **then splits it into 2 3 carbon molecules** (carbon fixation)
- rubisco is in **stroma of mesophyll cells in c3 plants**

---
- oxygen is competitive inhibitor for rubisco

Rubisco's affinity for o2 (not co2) ^ when:
^ temperature
Also binds to o2 more when
v humidity (^ dryness)
^ concentration

Photorespiration
- when rubisco attaches to O2 instead of CO2
- **produces co2** (undoing the work of photosynthesis)
- **Wastes energy** and does not allow calvin cycle to continue- no glucose production

Why do hot, dry conditions cause more photorespiration?
- **hot and dry meaning stomatas closed**
- meaning oxygen cannot get out
- meaning more oxygen inside for rubisco
