title: U3 Biochemical pathways
---
a series of linked biochemical reactions where the product of one reaction is the reactant of the next (and each step is facilitated by specific enzymes and coenzymes.
eg. cellular resp and photosynthesis)
- when asked for def don't use the word "pathway" in your response

**Photosynthesis + cellresp overview:**

 don't need to know how to write the balanced chemical and word equation for cellresp or photosynthesis

cytosol- the fluid portion of the cell
cytoplasm- the fluid + all the stuff in the membrane excluding the nucleus

**ATP**
- Adenosine triphosphate
	- there are 3 phosphates
	- 1 ribose
	- 1 adenine
- **high energy organic molecule** that can release energy when needed by cells

ADP + Pi   -> the i represents an inorganic phosphate (one that is just by itself, connects to form ATP)
Adding Pi to ADP creates ATP

**Factors quick memorise:**
the general factors that impact on enzyme function in relation to photosynthesis and cellular respiration: changes in temperature, pH, concentration, competitive and non-competitive enzyme inhibitors
- all have temperature
- all concentrations plateu
	- substrate concentration
	- oxygen concentration/glucose availability
	- carbon dioxide concentration/light and water **availability**
- pH for enzyme activity
- competitive and non competitive inhibition for enzyme activity

**Not assessable but helpful to know:**
catabolic reactions
- breaking down large molecules into smaller ones with an exergonic reaction (reaction that releases energy)

Eg: aerobic cellular respiration where glucose is broken down into carbon dioxide and water

Anabolic reactions
- building larger molecules from smaller ones, endergonic (intake energy)
examples: combining amino acids to form peptide bonds, photosynthesis where carbon dioxide and water join to form glucose and oxygen

**Sac 2 teacher feedback**
Students generally wrote more concise responses which was pleasing.
If you forgot units' multiple times (qu. 1a, 1d and 4) you were only penalised once.
If you are preparing for SACS only a few days before the date, it is evident as ideas get confused (such as CR and photosynthesis) and your answers are less refined. You need to allow time to complete practice SACs, reflect on how you have gone and apply your reflection to a new practice task.
The students achieving the higher scores are correctly using biological terminology - this is needed for the 2nd and 3rd marks in questions,
Each SAC will include something from the preparation to reward those doing the work - something to consider for SAC 3 (week 3 of Term 3).
