## Stem cell

- a cell that has a specific function- specialised cells
- stem cells are undifferentiated cells with the capabity of differentiating into specialised cells.
- (basically cells that are yet to be specialised)

Stem cell harvesting sites

1. Embryonic stem cells
    - have not specialised
    - collected up to **4 days** after fertilization
    - can replicate indefinitely
2. Adult stem cells
    - can specialise to limited range of cells (they are multipotent or unipotent)
    - Present in small numbers in some adult tissues (e.g bone marrow)
    - cannot replicate indefinitely
3. Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPS cells)
    - derived from skin or blood cells that have been programmed back into embryonic-like pluripotent state
    - can specialise into any type of human cell

Usefulness of stem cells in personalised medical treatment

Potency of stem cell- their ability to specialised cells

Totipotent: capable of giving rise to any cell type or even another embryo. A zygote up to the 16-cell morula stage.

Pluripotent: can differentiate into any of the three germ layers: endoderm (e.g. lungs and liver), mesoderm (e.g. muscle, bone) or ectoderm (e.g. skin & nervous system). Present in blastocysts.

Multipotent: have the ability to give rise to multiple, but limited cell types. Haematopoietic (blood forming) stem cells from bone marrow are an example. They give rise to various blood cells.

Unipotent: only differentiate into one cell type found in a specific tissue but can divide repeatedly. e.g. skin cells.

Embryonic development

1. fertilised egg
2. morula (ball of stem cells)
3. blastocyst (cells begin to specialise)
4. gastrula (3 different layers of cells)
5. embryo (in between fertilisation and development of characteristics)
6. foetus (develops major structures of the adult)

**Gastrula**

splits into 3 layers with different types of stem cells-

1. ectoderm (nervous system, skin)
2. mesoderm (bones, muscles, kidneys, reproductive system)
3. endoderm (endocrine, liver, lungs, digestive tract)

apoptosis

Stem cell therapy can only be done with bone marrow at the momentsc

stem cells under the skin to regenerate skin

stem cells turn into any kind of animal (human) cell (the stem cells we are learning this unit)

why would you want stem cells:

- if an old cell broke you need a new one to replace with the same function
- growing
- red blood cells are made every day. they live for 90 days

- learning how to grow stems cells is the future of medical advancements-regenerative medicine
