- **random event causing random changes in allele frequencies** (and a population's overall diversity),
- particularly in small populations (as contribution of individual to gene pool is comparatively large -> reduced adaptability to changing conditions)
- rarely causes adaptations

#### Examples of genetic drift

**Population bottlenecks**
- **sharp reduction** in size of a population due to random environmental **events**, disasters or human activities

**Founder effect**
- when small **unrepresentative** sample of individuals emigrate or become isolated from their original population
- as a consequence may evolve in a different direction

for both of these, population may be susceptible to inbreeding and low genetic variation.
small populations -> susceptible to random genetic drift
use words- diversity, allele frequency, founding population, unrepresentative, vulnerable, genetic drift, variation (of genes)
- key words from the question
- key words responding to question (lower, smaller, limited etc)
