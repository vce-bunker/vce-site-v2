title: U4 Genetic variation
---


**species**
group of individuals that can interbreed and produce viable, fertile offspring

**Hybrids**
- offspring between different species
- viable but not fertile
- eg mules

**Factors influencing genetic diversity** (and allele frequencies)
- In question say [factor]
	--> greater variety of genes and alleles,
	--> greater number of genotypes and phenotypes
	--> resulting in increased genetic diversity.

"many marks missed were due to lack of detail - biological language is needed to gain higher marks. When justifying/giving evidence,- you cannot use the same reasoning twice."
