#### Sympatric Speciation
**within** a population (w/o isolation; same geographical area), causing individuals with certain phenotypes to diverge from others and form a new species.

(basically speciation without a barrier)
- still some gene flow

divided by a pre-zygotic isolation barrier such as temporal or behavioural isolation

Lord Howe Island
- isolated volcanic island
- two species of palms diverged (driven by different flowering times of palm trees, which differ on different soils)
- Palms in basic soils flower earlier than in acidic soil (don't need to know)
- **barrier is the flowering time, not soil type**

|               | soil type | flowering time |
| ------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| H Forsteriana | basic     | earlier        |
| H Belmoreana  | acidic    | later          |

don't need to know leaf shape or flower spikes in table
but still need to know the two flowers and the other stuff in the table (not six weeks, just earlier or later) (belmoriana, forsteriana)

**Sympatric speciation in palms on Lord Howe island**
ancestor palm from australia colonised Lord Howe Island  
variation exists in the population of ancestral palms (some more adapted to calcareous and volcanic)  
Some seeds germinated in volcanic soil  
and others germinated in more calcareous soil (alkaline + nutrient poor)  
  
Stress to plant impacted flowering time  
  
palms on voilcanic soil flowered ~6 weeks after palms on calcareous soil  
  
Gene flow reduced by temporal reproductive isolation  
  
genetic differences accumulated due mutations and differing selection pressures therefore and different phenotypes being favoured (palms became better adapted to growing in acidic/alkaline soil - altering allele frequencies)  
  
palms genetically diverged and are no longer able to interbreed and produce viable fertile offspring
