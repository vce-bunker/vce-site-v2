- **movement of alleles** between populations/gene pools (migration) **by interbreeding**. (whenever mention gene flow must say by interbreeding)

- emigration (moving out) - moving out, decreases allele variety if not representative of whole population
- immigration (moving in) - increase allele variety

How does population size affect allele frequency?
- larger populations -> more stable, less affected by changes involving only a few individuals
- whereas smaller populations -> fewer alleles to begin with so speed of changes are greater
