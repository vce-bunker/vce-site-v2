## Mutations

**permanent alterations of DNA of chromosomes** that contribute to genetic variation within a population by giving rise to **NEW** alleles.


#### Fitness
- **survival** and **reproductive success** of an organism

cause:
Spontaneous - caused by natural body functions
exposure to mutagens - non natural cause
	- eg radiation

**Inheritable?**
- if germline cells:
	- yes
	else
	- no (eg somatic cells)
