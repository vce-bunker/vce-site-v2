#### point

**silent**
- DEGENERACY

**missense**
- aka substitution

**nonsense**
- causes a stop codon

common question - how many amino acids produced from a given nonsense chain

say "even though silent, the new sequence results in a new allele" if asked for effect on alleles

**Explain why a missense mutation may be harmful**
when amino acid is changed, the primary structure of the polypeptide is altered, can cause **abnormal folding**, altering 3d tertiary structure and this can affect **biological functionality** of the protein. **If protein is important as enzyme or structural protein, important biological processes may not occur, affecting survival of an organism**


#### frameshift

**insertions**

**deletions**

- everything downstream affected


#### block (chromosomal)

Duplication
- section of DNA is repeated (one section moves into its homologous counterpart)

Deletion
- a section of DNA is missing

Inversion
- section of dna is backwards

Translocation
- duplication except the chromosomes were not homologous
