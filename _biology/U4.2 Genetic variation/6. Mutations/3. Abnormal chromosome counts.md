Monoploidy
- only haploid number of chromosomes
- eg drone bees

Polyploidy
- aneuploidy but duplicate all chromosomes
- cells with haploid have diploid instead
- leading to triploids or tetraploids when fertilization
- eg some fish plants algae - increased size and hardiness

Aneuploidy
- abnormal number of chromosomes (eg 2n-1 or 2n+1)
- usually caused by **NON DISJUNCTION DURING MEIOSIS** *(failure of homologous*  
*chromosomes to separate during*  
*Meiosis I or failure of sister chromatids*  
*to separate during Meiosis II)*
- monosomy,  trisomy, tetrasomy or polysomy…
- Eg: Downs Syndrome (trisomy on chromosome 21), Edwards Syndrome (18),Turner's syndrome (X - nothing for gender, female)

Monosomy:

Aneuploidy involving a chromosome pair missing a chromosome – one homologue instead of two.

Monosomy of autosomes causes embryonic death.
