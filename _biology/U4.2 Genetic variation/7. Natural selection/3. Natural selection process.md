VEARC - process of natural selection vcaa response
(note in below it's veac because reproduction was combined)

**Variation**
Variation exists between individuals in the original/ancestral population, whereby some individuals are more adapted to the ___ due to spontaneous mutations. Variation is heritable when individuals reproduce

**Environment** 
[identify change in environment] (selection pressure, acts on **phenotypes**) and **how** this **selection pressure** impacts on individuals **survival and ability to reproduce** (the bad traits)

**Advantage**
(explain how individuals with the **selective advantage / fittest phenotype** are at an advantage and are able to survive and reproduce & **pass on** their **advantageous alleles** **to the next generation**)

**Change**
**contribute** to a greater proportion of the **gene pool**

over generations causes an increase in the frequency of advantageous allele - # of this allele in the population increases  
  
means evolution is occurring
