[Accepted abbreviations](assets/vcaa-accepted-abbreviations.md)

cannot put the same thing into two cells in a table question or will lose mark
when given 2 choices must compare (even when it doesn't say compare)
Compare
- provide similarity and difference (amount based on marks given)
reword and analyse/expand when the question already gave you the answer in the extra info

in test
- make definitions "crisp"
- clear trps/processes/steps
- number of lines is usually how much expected + maybe one more line
- use biological terminology



- can't abbreviate them (unless in the question it already uses the abbreviation and states what the full name is)

- practice sacs and practice tests on canvas
- reflect on practice sacs
- if not sure about question email to teacher

- generally single word answers answering part of a 3 mark question don't give a mark but will lose mark if wrong

- when saying samples, say what the samples are
basically when you write a noun write all synonyms
- vcaa don't want answers in absolutes, eg don't say completely stopped but instead say dropped/extremely low/little to no effect
	- e.g they haven't all denatured at eg 50 degrees, a lot are beginning to denature, some haven't started

- cannot give the same answer for 2 different related questions

- never say the word "amount". Instead say mass, number, etc
