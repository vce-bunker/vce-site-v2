# vce notes
notes for vce (3,4 study designs in 2026) (2025 for accounting and biology)

Initially made in 2024 (excluding the stylesheet). I was dumb back then and didn't use an SSG because I didn't think the site would get that big.
Moved to jekyll jan 2026.

Note: not affiliated with the vcaa or vtac. (I am just a student who uses this website to store notes)
