∆T = 26.0-25.0 = 1.0\*C
CF = $\frac{4.2*5*180}{8.0}$ =472.5J/\*C >> 0.47kJ/\*C

Functions (using vars) (basically a var except it's an arrow instead of an =. Can use as variable)
ℰ$_2$(state formula here optional) $\rightarrow CF = \frac{▯}{∆T}$
↳0.47kJ

- (↳ after a function is "extract the ▯ value", as using equals wouldn't work mathematically)
	- can also just use a normal right arrow if doing inline
- writing the units in the function is optional but recommended to allow for type checking (eg don't accidentally use the J value for kJ))
- the "\_2" is optional, it is just if you already have a "\_1"

therefore character- use as required
