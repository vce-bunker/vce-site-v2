## Specifics (Notes while doing practice exams)
- critical elements- elements essential in human society that have scarce/uncertain future supply

- Calculating relative isotopic mass
	- it is the average atomic mass of all isotopes
	- if one isotope is 4 times more common, it will be weighted as such when calculating avg.

- high temperature- increased ionisation of water- lower pH (because more H+ and OH-)
- pure water is neutral at any temperature as [h3o+] = [OH-]
- high pH= alkaline (basic)

- thermosetting polymers have strong covalent cross-links;  causing charring/ degradation when heated

- antacid- a thing that neutralizes stomach acidity

- uv visible spectroscopy
	- amount of light absorbed is directly proportional to ion concentration
	- therefore through standards or calibration curve can determine concentration

- methyl ethanoate - the single bond h in the ethanoic acid carbxyl group and a h in the methyl condensation reaction, peptide bond the rest together

- $H_2CO_3$ isn't created in neutralization reaction because it immediately turns into $H_2O$ and $CO_2$

- acids donate h+

- greater h3o concentration increases conductivity

- always convert 200 to $2*10^2$ just in case (because not sure about sig figs need to ask teacher)
___

- specific heat capacity- energy required to raise heat of a substance
- latent heat of vaporization- energy required to change from liquid to gas at a constant temperature

- remember to write "+nH2O" when drawing an extract of an addition polymer

- what is an ionic bond?
	1. **electrostatic attractions**
	2. electrons transferred between atoms to form positive and negative ions

what is the redox number of O in metal-O?
### What to learn
- know what acids/bases are weak and strong
- Redox rules
- How is a precipitate formed  
	- ~~salts table memorize (the ones not in the formula sheet)~~
- Calculate pH  
		how does pH correspond to oh (increase pH) and h+ ions (or oh-) (decrease pH)
- Does standard soln normally go in which
	- standard goes into the burette
- requirements for a standard solution
- the organic table
	- like the ketones and aldehydes
- plastics and stuff
- e=qmcnt and q= nl what the letters represent
- monoprotic meaning
