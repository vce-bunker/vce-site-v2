an acid base reaction that results in a neutral solution

General formula:
acid + base --> salt + water

acid + metal hydroxide -> salt + water  
$2NaOH(aq)+H_2SO_4(aq)\rightarrow Na_2SO_4(aq)+2H_2O(l)$  
acid + metal oxide -> salt + water  
acid + metal carbonate -> salt + $CO_2$ + $H_2O$  
acid + metal hydrogen carbonate -> salt + $CO_2$ + $H_2O$  
$CaCO_3(aq) + H_2SO_4(aq)\rightarrow CaSO_4(aq) + CO_2(g) + H_2O(l)$  

salt = any ionic compound

an alkali is a soluble base.
- eg OH-, O2-, (CO3)2-
- if o2 or co32-, vcaa will give states. If they don't, don't write states.

**Ionic equations** for reactions of acids
1. write down the full equation
2. separate the ionic, aqueous compounds apart, eg NaOH(aq) becomes Na+(aq) and OH-(aq)
3. cancel any ions that are the same on both sides of the equation
4. simplify the equation if needed

 $H_2CO_3$ isn't created in neutralization reaction because it immediately turns into $H_2O$ and $CO_2$

#### Calculating pH
- process of splitting into ions  

self ionisation of water
- water is a very weak acid and base
- pure water will have low amounts of $H_3O^+$ and $OH^-$

$Kw: [H_3O^+concentration][OH^-concentration]=10^{-14}$ (at 25 degrees C)
higher $H_3O^+$ concentration = lower pH = higher acidity

pH = $-log_{10}(H_3O^+ (or  H^+)concentration)$

If diprotic multiply by 2

Example question
0.01M solution of $Ca(OH)_2$ is prepared by adding water. Calculate pH of solution.
1. write balanced equation
	$Ca(OH)_2(s)\rightarrow Ca^{2+}(aq)+2OH^-(aq)$
2. Calculate OH- concentration
	 2x 0.01M = 0.02M
3. Plug into formula to find H3O concentration
	 5x10^-13 M
4. Plug into pH formula
	 12.3
