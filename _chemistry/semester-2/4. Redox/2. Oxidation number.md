1. Sum of oxidation numbers is the charge (also any free element (eg $Cl_2$) is 0)
2. Main group metal- equal to charge
3. Hydrogen
	1. +1
	2. -1 if metal hydride   (metal H or $H_2$ etc, eg $NaH$ and $MgH_2$)
4. Oxygen
	1. -2
	2. With fluorine = +2
	3. In peroxides (main group metal - $O_2$ (eg $Na_2O_2$) or $H_2O_2$) = -1
5. Halogens (group 17) in group 1 and 2 compounds = -1
6. Most electronegative element is assigned negative value eg OF$_2$   (O is +2) (remember more electronegative = top right excl noble gases) 

**Electrochemical Series**
- Higher (left side) = strongest to be reduced (oxidant)
- Lower (right side) = strongest to be oxidised (reductant) (and more likely to displace)
