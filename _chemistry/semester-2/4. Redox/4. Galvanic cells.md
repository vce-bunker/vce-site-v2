#### AN OIL RIG CAT
anode - oxidation
cathode - reduction

**Why?**
- electrons attracted from Zn (oxidation) to positive end (Cu$^2+$)

Note that there is an NO$^3-$ solution in each side which forms a molecule with the Zn and Cu

**Function of salt bridge**
[state \_ moves to cathode, \_ to anode] Balance electrolyte charge back to neutral so redox reaction can continue, and to complete the internal circuit
- prevents the accumulation of charge in the cells (don't say neutralize)
- Make sure to choose something with NO3- to use as the salt bridge (to be safe)
- remember eg KNO3 - the K = Kathode
- Inert (unreactive), soluble ionic compound

**Half cells**
Separates the oxidising agent + reducing agent
preventing a direct spontaneous reaction where heat energy would be produced, not electrical energy

**Daniell Cell**
A galvanic cell that uses zinc and copper

**Potential difference**
the difference $E^0$ number of the two elements (Cu and Zn in this case) in the electrochemical series

**Indirect reaction**
The oxidising agent and salt bridge are not in contact with each other

**Why are the reactants separated (into 2 half cells?)**
so that electrical energy is released rather than heat energy when the reaction occurs. Electrical energy released as electrons can only be transferred through an external circuit

**Electrodes** (on sac: specific design features that allow electrode to help cell run)
- solid, conduct electricity
- don't say "mass" changed when asked for observation, say "size"
- porous - ==allow ions from the electrolyte to come into contact w. gases== (O2 and fuel), allowing reduction/oxidation to occur on the electrode surface
	- fuel cells have porous electrodes while primary cells don't.
	- O2(g) and the fuel do not come into direct contact. Indirect, spontaneous reaction.
- contain catalysts to increase the rate of reaction (in fuel cells)

**Inert electrodes**
- Pt, Graphite or a gas electrode
- Used when a nonmetal is present
- As they do not take part in the redox they are not consumed so they can be used indefinitely
- eg hydrogen is pumped in as one of the reactants
- platinum or some other thing us used as the electrode instead and is not used up.

Species
- $Zn_{(s)}$
- $H_2O_{(l)}$
- $Zn^{2+}(aq)$
- ${SO_4}^{2-}(aq)$ (not on elec. series (sulfur is its highest o. number it can be - it can't lose any more))
- $Cu^{2+}(aq)$
- $Cu(s)$
