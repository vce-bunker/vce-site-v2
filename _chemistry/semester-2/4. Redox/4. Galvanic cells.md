#### AN OIL RIG CAT
anode - oxidation
cathode - reduction

**Why?**
- electrons attracted from Zn (oxidation) to positive end (Cu$^2+$)

Note that there is an NO$^3-$ solution in each side which forms a molecule with the Zn and Cu

**Function of salt bridge**
Balance electrolyte charge back to neutral so redox reaction can continue, and to complete the internal circuit
- Make sure to choose something with NO3- to use as the salt bridge (to be safe)

**Daniell Cell**
A galvanic cell that uses zinc and copper

**Potential difference**
the difference $E^0$ number of the two elements (Cu and Zn in this case) in the electrochemical series

**Indirect reaction**
The oxidising agent and salt bridge are not in contact with each other

**Why are the reactants separated (into 2 half cells?)**
so that electrical energy is released rather than heat energy when the reaction occurs. Electrical energy released as electrons can only be transferred through an external circuit

**Inert electrodes**
- Pt, Graphite or a gas electrode
- Used when a nonmetal is present
- As they do not take part in the redox they are not consumed so they can be used indefinitely
- eg hydrogen is pumped in as one of the reactants
- platinum or some other thing us used as the electrode instead and is not used up.
