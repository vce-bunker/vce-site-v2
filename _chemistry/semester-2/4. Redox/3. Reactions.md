**Redox reactions**
A reaction in which the redox number changes (one element oxidises and another reduces)
- eg displacement reactions

Reduction is said to have occurred when a metallic ion becomes a neutral atom

**Standard response**
__ oxidised from __ to __ , losing electrons
__ reduced from __ to __ , gaining electrons
(3 key points)

**Half equations**
- half of a redox (showing the oxidation/reduction independently)
- $Fe(s) \rightarrow Fe^{3+}(aq) + 3e^-$
- $Cl_2(g)+ 2e^- \rightarrow 2Cl^-(aq)$
Note that you cannot do a $-e^-$
- Combining:
	$2Fe(s)+3Cl_2(g) \rightarrow 2Fe^{3+}(aq)+6Cl^-(aq)$
Don't write the Fe and Cl as one molecule

Ionic compounds can be split apart into its ions. But you aren't allowed to split a covalent (eg $Br_2(s)$)

**KOHES**
- for half equations with ==polyatomic ions==
- K- Balance key elements (ignore O and H)
- O- Balance O by adding $H_2O$
- H- Balance H by adding $H^+$ ions
	- if it is in alkaline (basic) conditions also add $OH^-$ to both sides to cancel the H+. $OH^-$ combines with the H+ to form water, which can be cancelled when on both sides.
- E- Balance charge by adding $e^-$
- S- Add states
- eg start with ${SO_3}^{2-}\rightarrow {SO_4}^{2-}$
- end: $H_2O(l) + {SO_3}^{2-}(aq) \rightarrow {SO_4}^{2-}(aq) + 2H^+(aq)$

**Predicting whether a spontaneous redox reaction will occur**
- a downhill slope connecting the two molecules on the electrochemical series
- "the ball can roll downhill but not uphill" / "backwards Z"
- spontaneous - it doesn't need the addition of energy to initiate the reaction

**States**
For this unit assume all the solutions/ions to be (aq), and the pure metals to be (s), and any obvious states eg $O_2 (g)$ and $H_2O (l)$
