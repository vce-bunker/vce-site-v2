**Types**:
- dry: metal + oxygen (no water)
	- not a redox
- wet: metal + oxygen + water
	- yes a redox
	- water conducts allowing fast electron movement
	- faster than dry corrosion

Salt in the air increases (the conductivity of the water and) the rate of rusting

**How to prevent**
- using a metal lower down in the electrochemical series
	- so it is able to react in place of the metal you are protecting
- covering in plastic 
	- non reactive, prevents water and oxygen getting to the metal
