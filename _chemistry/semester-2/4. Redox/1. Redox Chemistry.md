> [!Key Knowledge]
> - Oxidising and reducing agents, and redox reactions, including writing of balanced half and overall redox equations (including in acidic conditions), with states.
> - The reactivity series of metals and metal displacement reactions, including balanced redox equations, with states.
> - Applications of redox reactions in society: for example, corrosion or the use of simple primary cells in the production of electrical energy from chemical energy.


> [!NOTE] 34 Key Knowledge
> - redox reactions as simultaneous oxidation and reduction processes, and the use of oxidation numbers to identify the reducing agent, oxidising agent and conjugate redox pairs
> - the writing of balanced half-equations (including states) for oxidation and reduction reactions, and the overall redox cell reaction in both acidic and basic conditions
> - the common design features and general operating principles of non rechargeable (primary) galvanic cells converting chemical energy into electrical energy, including electrode polarities and the role of the electrodes (inert and reactive) and electrolyte solutions (details of specific cells not required)
> - the use and limitations of the electrochemical series in designing galvanic cells and as a tool for predicting the products of redox reactions, for deducing overall equations from redox half-equations and for determining maximum cell voltage under standard conditions
> - the application of  Faraday's laws and stoichiometry to determine the quantity of galvanic or fuel cell reactant and product, and the current or time required to either use a particular quantity of product
