**Volumetric analysis**
use of solution with known concentration and volume to determine the concentration or mass of a solution with a known volume

**Equivalence point**
When chemically equivalent amounts of acid and base, according to mole ratio of the equation, are present

**End point**
When the solution permanently changes colour

**Titre**
Volume of solution added from the burette

**Aliquot**
Known volume of solution delivered from a pipette

**Concordant titres**
Measured data in a specified range (eg. $\pm 0.1ml$ of each other)

**Standard solution**
- accurately known concentration
- readily available in pure form
- Known formula
- Inexpensive
- High molar mass
- Easy to store without deteriorating or reacting with the atmosphere (not react with water)

**Titration curves**
the large spike represents the equivalence point, the levelling off is the endpoint

**Burette**
The long glass tube thing with a tap at the end

**What to rinse**
Burette- solution going in (titrant solution)- ensures concentrations remain unchanged
Conical flask - deionised water- does not affect moles of solution
Pipette - solution going in - ensure concentration remains unchanged

**Importance of choosing the correct indicator**
endpt must be as close as possible to equivalence point to be able to effectively identify it
