**Preparation of a standard solution**
basically you are getting a known mass of a molecule and mixing it with known volume of deionised water
- calculate mol/L
 
**Using mean tire to calculate concentration of x in unknown solution**
1. get the mol of the standard using its concentration and avg titre.
2. use this mol and the equation to find the mol of x
3. use the *mol of x* and the *volume of the solution x was in (eg vinegar) before more solution was added to the conical flask* to find concentration of x
