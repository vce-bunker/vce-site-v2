2 soluble solutions mixed
result in a "salt" being produced
- which can be measured using gravimetric analysis

Mixing two soluble solutions to get an insoluble product
	swapping the metals of two molecules
	 $Cu(NO_3)_{2(aq)}  + 2NaOH(aq) \rightarrow Cu(OH)_{2(s)} + 2NaNO_{3(aq)}$
- the insoluble product is the precipitate
- participating ions is the ions that form the precipirate
- spectator ions are the others, excluded from ionic equations
	- "do not undergo chemical changes"

Note also cancel ions that are the same on both sides of ionic equation
- for ionic equation steps check acid bases (neutralization) section

For metal carbonates
__ + __ $CO_3 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O +$ __

States:
- assume all ions are aq
- use solubility table for the compound

- E.g., Mg(OH)2 is insoluble in water.
- We can see this by looking at the OH- row… all compounds containing OH are insoluble except if it is with NH4, Ca, Sr and Ba.

Example question
•Will a precipitate be formed when a solution of magnesium nitrate, Mg(NO3)2 and a solution of sodium hydroxide, NaOH are mixed?
•$Mg(NO_3)_2 (aq) + 2NaOH (aq) \rightarrow  Mg(OH)_2 (s) + 2NaNO_3 (aq)$
1. write reactants down.
2. write products down. (swapping cations – make sure they are the correct ratio/ionic formula)
3. Use the solubility table to find if the products are soluble or insoluble.
4. Indicate the precipitate by stating that it is a solid (s) rather than aqueous (aq).
5. Make sure equation is balanced.
