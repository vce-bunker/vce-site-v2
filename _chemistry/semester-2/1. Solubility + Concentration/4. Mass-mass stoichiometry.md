**Limiting reactants**
the reactants that are fully consumed first in a reaction, limiting the amount of products formed

**How**
1. write balanced equation
2. calculate mol of both reactants
3. compare calculated and theoretical mol
4. use mol of limiting reactant to calculate mol of product
5. calculate mass of product
6. sig figs

eg. if a reaction occurs between 6.25 mols hcl and 2.75 moles Ca(OH)2, determine:
- $2HCl_{(aq)} + Ca(OH)_{2(aq)} \rightarrow CaCl_{2(aq)} + 2H_2O_{(l)}$
- limiting reactant (ca(oh)2) (because 6.25 > 2x 2.75)
- mass of ionic compound produced (305.195g)
- mass of excess reactant left over (27.35g)f
