> - Define solution concentration as a measure of the quantity of solute dissolved in a given mass or volume of solution and calculate in terms of (mol/L, g/L, %(m/v), %(v/v), ppm), including unit conversions  
> - Use solubility tables to predict and identify precipitation reactions between ions in solution and write fully balanced and ionic equations, including the state symbols: (s), (l), (aq) and (g)  
> - Use solubility tables to predict experimental determination of ionic compound solubility  
> - Use precipitation reactions to remove impurities from water

**Solute concentration** (memorise this)
measure of the quantity of solute dissolved in a given mass or volume of solution
(amount of substance in a given volume)

**Solubility**
the degree to which a solute dissolves in a solvent.
All substances vary in their solubility in a particular solvent.

'Like dissolves like' - polar solutes will dissolve in a polar solvent and vice versa.

**Unsaturated**: **less solute** than needed to form a saturated solution.
**Saturated:** no more **solute** can be dissolved at a particular temperature.
