- forms ion-dipole attractions with the water
- ions pulled out of the lattice
- surrounded by water = hydrated
- **must draw dipole charges (delta - on oxygen if substance is a cation, delta + on hydrogens. none on the ion but say eg zn2+)**

Dissolution- freeing ions from the lattice
Ionisation- reacting with water forms new ions
