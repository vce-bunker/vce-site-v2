**Kinetic Molecular theory**
- Describes a set of characteristics of an imaginary gas known as ***The Ideal Gas***.
- This gas approximates the behaviour of all real gases (to be close enough to be able to do calculations)
- All questions in unit 3 4 use the ideal gas (not any specific gas).

Gas Assumptions

| No forces exist between ideal gas molecules (no attract or repel) | Gases expand/compress to fill space |
| The volume of the gas is neglible compared to container           |                                     |
| Energy is conserved in collisions (elastic)                       | Inflated tyre remains inflated      |
| Avg KE ^ as gas temp ^                                            |                                     |

KE at temp
- At a given temperature not all the molecules have the same KE.
- However for a given sample of gas with given temperature there will always be the same average speed.
