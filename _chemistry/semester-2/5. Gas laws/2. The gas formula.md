### Pressure
- based on number of collisions of gas particles with the sides of the container
- causes- ^ temp, v container volume
- defined as force per unit area
- SLC = 100kPa and 25\*C

**Units of pressure**

|        |      |                        |
| ------ | ---- | ---------------------- |
| 1      | atm  | atmosphere             |
| 760    | mmHg | millimetres of mercury |
| 101325 | Pa   | pascals                |

|         |     |
| ------- | --- |
| 1       | Bar |
| 100     | KPa |
| 100,000 | Pa  |

The pressure in a container is the sum of the pressures of each different type of molecule in the container (eg oxygen and nitrogen)

**The Gas formula**
## $$PV = nRT$$
P = kPa
V = Litres
n = moles
R = 8.31 (the gas constant)
T = Kelvin

**The combined gas formula** (for changing conditions)
## $$\frac{P_1V_1}{n_1T_1}=\frac{P_2V_2}{n_2T_2}$$

**The shortcut formula you use if under SLC**
## $$n = \frac{V}{24.8}$$
in this case 24.8 is the *molar volume*
- the volume that 1 mol of gas will occupy
- quick calculation: pv=nrt -> $RT / P$
