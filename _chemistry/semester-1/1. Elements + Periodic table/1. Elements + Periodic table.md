T1 wk1-2
> [!Key Knowledge]
>- The definitions of elements, isotopes and ions, including appropriate notation: atomic number; mass number; and number of protons, neutrons and electrons.
> - The periodic table as an organisational tool to identify patterns and trends in, and relationships between, the structures (including shell and subshell electronic configurations and atomic radii) and properties (including electronegativity, first ionisation energy, metallic and non-metallic character and reactivity) of elements.
> - Critical elements (for example He, P, rare-earth elements and post transition metals and metalloids)n and the importance of recycling processes for element recovery,

T1A wk3-4 (Ionic + Metallic bonding)
> [!Key Knowledge]
> - The formation of ionic compounds through the transfer of electrons from metals to non-metals and the writing of ionic compounds formulas, including those containing polyatomic ions and transition metal ions  
> - Deduction of the formula and name of an ionic compound from its component ions, including polyatomic ions (NH4+, OH-, NO3-, HCO3-, CO32-, SO42-, PO43-)  
> - The common properties of ionic compounds (including brittleness, hardness, melting point, electrical conductivity in solid/molten/liquid states), with reference to the nature of ionic bonding and crystal lattice structure
> - The common properties of metals (lustre, malleability, ductility, melting point, heat conductivity and electrical conductivity) with reference to the nature of metallic bonding and the existence of metallic crystals
> - Experimental determination of a reactivity series of metals based on their relative ability to undergo oxidation with water, acids and oxygen
> - Metal recycling as an example of a circular economy where metal is mined, refined, made into a product, used, disposed of via recycling and then reprocessed as the same original product or repurposed as a new product

Ground state (in subshell config)
The ground state is the lowest energy state where the orbitals are filled from lowest energy level to highest energy level
