#### Ionic bonding
- Electrons transferred
- Electrostatic attraction

Swap and drop
Use Data book

Eg
$Li^+$   $O^{2-}$  =   $Li_2O$ Lithium oxide

Note: if there are multiple of the same element, you need to draw each one

#### Ionic compound properties
- High melting/boiling temp
	- needs lots of energy to reduce electrostatic attraction in lattice
- Hard + brittle
	- strong forces of attraction between particles -> strong force required to disrupt lattice structure
	- brittle (shatter)
		- when you knock the lattice the layers shift and suddenly the protons are lined up with protons and electrons with electrons - causing repelling (shatter)
- Conductive when melted/dissolved
	- no more lattice, ions now free to move
	- will be in test

#### Metallic bonding model
- tightly packed
- lattice structure
- cations
- sea of delocalised electrons

- The electrons move around and attract cations which holds them all together (metallic bonding)
- Model can be used to explain metal hardness

Some limitations: model cannot explain:
- Difference in density and conductivity between metals
- Rapid movement of delocalised electrons through structure

**Metal reactions**
metal (s) + water (l) -> metal hydroxide (aq) + hydrogen (g)
$2Na + H_2O \rightarrow 2NaOH + H_2$

metal (s) + acid (aq) -> salt (aq) + hydrogen (g)
$Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) \rightarrow MgCl_2(aq) + H_2(g)$

metal (s) + oxygen (g) -> metal oxide (s)
$2Ca + O_2 \rightarrow 2CaO$

**Displacement**
- use electrochemical series
- see displacement section of notes (insert link here)
