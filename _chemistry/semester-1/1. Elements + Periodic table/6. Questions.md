___
Electronegativity increases from left to right across a period* due to the increase in effective  
nuclear charge (core charge) * and decreases down a group* due to increased number of  
electron shells and that electrons are further from the nucleus*.  
b. Atomic radius decreases from left to right across a period* due to increased core charge  
attracting electrons* and increases down a group* due to the increased number of electron  
shells*.  
c. First ionization energy increases from left to right across a period* due to the increase in  
effective nuclear charge (core charge) * and decreases down a group* due to increased  
number of electron shells and that electrons are further from the nucleus*.  
d. Reactivity of an atom depends on how easily the atom can lose or gain electrons. For non-  
metals (gain electrons) reactivity increases with high electronegativity* and high first  
ionization energy*, while for metals (lose electrons) reactivity increases with low  
electronegativity* and low first ionization energy*.
