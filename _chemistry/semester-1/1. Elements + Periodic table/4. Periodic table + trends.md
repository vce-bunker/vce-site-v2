**Groups** (vertical)
- same # of valence electrons
- add electrons as go right a group

**Periods** (horizontal)
- same # of shells
- add 1 shell as go down a period
- remember- periods are horizontal in your timetable

Learn the locations of metals, nonmetals and metalloids in the periodic table.

**Metallic character**
- Shiny (lustre)
	- delocalised electrons can reflect light
- Conductive
	- delocalised electrons can carry current
- High melting/boiling points
	- Strong electrostatic atractioon between cations and delocalised electrons
- Opaque
- Form cations
- Strong
- Ductile (stretchable) and Malleable (pressed into shape without cracking)
	- delocalised electrons are free to slide

**Nonmetals**
- Opposite of all
- Brittle when solid
- Dull colour
- Transparent in thin sheet
### Trends
Know:

Core charge
- *Electrostatic attraction* of outer shell electrons

Atomic radius
- Distance from centre to valence

Electronegativity
- Ability to attract shared (bonding) electrons
- Noble cases have 0 because they already have full outer shell
- remember FONCl (decreasing electronegativity order)

1st ionisation energy
- Energy required to remove 1st valence electron
- Exception- Oxygen slightly less than nitrogen

Metal/nonmetal reactivity
- How easily it can lose/gain electrons

**Direction of trends in periodic table**

- Metallic character/reactivity
- Atomic radius
# ↗
- Nonmetallic character/reactivity
- Core charge
- Ionisation energy
- Electronegativity

**Why?**
- More shells:
	- the valence electrons are further away from the nucleus and therefore have weaker attraction
- More valence electrons
	- more means together they can create a stronger attraction (and also get drawn closer to nucleus)
