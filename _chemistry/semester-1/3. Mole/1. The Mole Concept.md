> [!Key Knowledge]
> - Determination of the relative atomic mass of an element using mass spectrometry (details of instrument not required)
> - The relative isotopic masses of isotopes of elements and their values on the scale in which the relative isotopic mass of the carbon-12 isotope is assigned a value of 12 exactly
> - Avogadro’s constant as the number 6.02 × 10^23 indicating the number of atoms or molecules in a mole of any substance; determination of the amount, in moles, of atoms (or molecules) in a pure sample of known mass
> - Determination of the molar mass of compounds, the percentage composition by mass of covalent compounds, and the empirical and molecular formula of a compound from its percentage composition by mass
> - Quantitative analysis of salts:
>     - molar ratio of water of hydration for an ionic compound
>     - the application of mass-mass stoichiometry to determine the mass present of an ionic compound

Learning Outcomes:
- Determine the molar mass of a compound from its formula
- Determine the percentage composition by mass of covalent compounds
- Define ‘empirical formula’
- Determine the empirical formula of a covalent compound from its percentage composition by mass
- Determine the molecular formula from an empirical formula given its molar mass

**Particle masses**
- Carbon 12 has been assigned an arbitary value of 12
- relative mass scale - particle masses are measured relative to C-12.
- More practical to use this than small masses in grams in calculations
- carbon 12 used because it is stable and easy to weigh
- Relative isotopic mass ($I_r$) is the mass of one atom of an isotope relative to the mass of one atom of Carbon 12.
	- can be measured using a mass spectrometer
		- separates individual isotopes based on size and charge
		- eg magnesium-24 will have a relative mass of ~24 (twice as massive as a carbon-12)

https://www.webelements.com/chlorine/isotopes.html
- 75% of the chlorine sample is 35 atomic mass
- 25% is 37
- there are 2 types of isotopes

> A naturally occurring sample of an element contains the same isotopes in the same proportions, regardless of its source.

- Relative atomic mass ((Ar) units = amu (optional)) - overall weighted average (influenced by isotope abundance) that is put in periodic table
- bascally analysing the graph and finding percentages, then using that to find atomic mass

**Molar mass** (g/mol)
- add together the relative atomic masses of each element in the compound

% composition of an element in a molecule
- textbook page 114
- molar mass of the element/molar mass of the compound * 100

**possible theory questions**
- define avogadro's number
- define relative mass scale
- define relative isotopic mass
- define empirical/molecular formula
- last page of diagnostics topic tests chem unit 1&2
- list the order of steps (given steps) arrange in order
