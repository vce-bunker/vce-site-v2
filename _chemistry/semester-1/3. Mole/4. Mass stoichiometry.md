the application of mass-mass stoichiometry to determine the mass present of an ionic compound
- n=m/M
- convert to mol first then figure out the mol of the unknown substance then convert back to mass (so that can take into account mass number)

Example:
A reaction between solutions of sodium sulfate and barium nitrate produces 2.50g of barium sulfate and a solution of sodium nitrate. Calculate the mass f sodium sulfate required to produce this mass of barium sulfate.
$$Na_2SO_4+Ba(NO_3)_2\rightarrow BaSO_4+2NaNO_3$$
1. take 2.50g and convert to mol because unsure if it is one mol
	n($BaSO_4$) = m/M = 2.50g÷233.4g/mol = 0.0107mol
2. in the equation as the mol of sodium sulfate and barium sulfate is the same, use 0.0107mol to find the mass of sodium sulfate.
	m($Na_2SO_4$) = 0.0107x142.1 = 1.520g



**Molar ratio of water of hydration for an ionic compound**
Example
A 2.60g mass of anhydrous magnesium sulfate is formed when 5.37g of hydrated magnesium sulfate is heated to constant mass (and therefore contains no more water). Use this data to determine the x value, a coefficient, in the empirical formula of hydrated magnesium sulfate $MgSO_4.xH_2O$.

|                        | $MgSO_4$   | $H_2O$          |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| 1. calculate the mass  | 2.60g      | 5.37-2.60=2.77g |
| 2. calculate g/mol     | 120.4g/mol | 18.0g/mol       |
| 3. calculate mol       | 0.0216mol  | 0.154mol        |
| 4. approximate a ratio | 1          | 7               |
therefore it is $MgSO_4.7H_2O$  (x=7).
