vsepr - valence shell electron pair repulsion
Molecular geometry (shape) affects polarity

Covalent bond shapes
Tetrahedral
$CH_4$ - the central atom will:
- 4 valence electrons
- forms 4 single bonds with other atoms

Pyramidal
$NH_3$
- 5 valence electrons
- 3 single bonds w/ other atoms
- one lone pair of electrons

V-shaped
$H_2O$
- 6 valence electrons
- 2 single bonds
- 2 lone pairs of electrons

Linear
$HCl$
- 7 valence electrons
- 1 single bond
	- except double bond ones eg C=O because carbon has no lone electrons and oxygens repel equally
