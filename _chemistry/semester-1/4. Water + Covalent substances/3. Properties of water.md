**Why is liquid more dense than ice?**
1. Because of hydrogen bonds holding water molecules further
2. $H_2O$ in ice is crystal structure
3. less $H_2O$ molecules in given volume

Group 16 hydride boiling point trends
- boiling points increase down the group, with the exclusion of water which can form hydrogen bonds.
- All molecules are bent & polar.
	- Electronegativity difference between H and O is the greatest than the other combinations

**Water has a low molar mass, but has a high boiling point. Why?**
- Water is the only hydride that has hydrogen bonds.
- The other hydrides have dipole-dipole and dispersion forces.
- The dispersion forces increase with increasing molar mass.
- Hydrogen bonds are stronger than dispersion forces.

Water density
The density of water is given in databook 1.0g/mL.

E (or q) = mc∆T
where:
E = Heat energy (joules)
m = mass of water (g) (if given volume multiple volume by density in databook to get mass)
∆T = change in temperature
c = specific heat capacity (J/g/°C)
- the quantity of energy (Joules, J) needed to increase the temperature of, usually 1g of a substance by 1°C.
- It is a measure of a substances ability to absorb and store heat.
- Water has a specific heat capacity of 4.18 J/g°C.

q = n L
where:
q = energy (kJ)
n = mol
L = latent heat value (data book)
- heat energy required to evaporate 1 mole of a substance. (kJ/mol)

Latent heat
the energy absorbed by a fixed amount of substance as it changes from one state to another. (How much energy required to change state)

## Properties of Molecular substances
low melting and boiling points
- it is easier to break intermolecular forces than intramolecular forces
- when a covalent molecular substance melts or boils, it is weak intermolecular forces that break, not the strong covalent bonds.

Exist as gases or liquids at room temperature
- as weak intermolecular forces

Not conductive
- because covalent molecules are neutral, no free e-.
