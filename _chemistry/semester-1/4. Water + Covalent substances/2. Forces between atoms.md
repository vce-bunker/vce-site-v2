**A molecule is polar when:**
- it contains polar covalent bonds
- asymmetrical

Non symmetrical - atoms have different electronegativity among the bonded atoms OR there are lone pairs of electrons on the central atom
Whereas symmetrical molecules like CH4 have 4 H's of equal strength pulling in opposite directions -> cancels out

**Polarity**
- uneven distribution of charge in a molecule
- determined by molecule shape + atom types involved
	- (electronegativity strength of attracting electrons)
	- differences in electronegativity of atoms involved determines polarity of a bond

example: HCl
- overall charge is zero but Cl is slightly negative (δ-), H slightly positive (δ+)
- Cl is more electronegative so it pulls the bonding pair closer to its nucleus.
	- the bonding pair spends more time closer to Cl than H.

Like dissolves like
Water is polar

Intermolecular forces
- between molecules
- dashed line
- double dashed line is stronger

Intramolecular
- between atoms within a molecule
- solid line

Bonds (numbers represent relative strength)
1000- Covalent bonds (intramolecular)
	 solid line
50- Hydrogen bonds
	- type of dipole dipole attraction
	- hydrogen attached to F/O/N on one molecule is bound to F/O/N on another atom which has a lone pair of e-.
10- Dipole dipole attraction
	- caused by permanent dipole movements (aka polar covalent bonds)
	- occurs between **polar** molecules
	- electrostatic attraction between a partial +ive charge (δ+) and partial -ive charce (δ-) on two different molecules
1- Dispersion forces
	- because e- are constantly moving they can create temporary dipoles between molecules
	- mark δδ- very slightly charged
	- the temporary -ive side is attracted to the temporary +ive side of a second molecule
	- as # of e- ^, or size of atom/molecule (molar mass) ^, dispersion strength ^.


Covalent compounds
- shared electrons
	- move between atoms
- typically non metals
- happens because the electronegativity difference is low
