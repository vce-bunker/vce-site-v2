> [!Key Knowledge]
> - The use of Lewis (electron dot) structures, structural formulas and molecular formulas to model the following molecules: hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, nitrogen, hydrogen chloride, carbon dioxide, water, ammonia, methane, ethane and ethene
> - Shapes of molecules (linear, bent, pyramidal, and tetrahedral, excluding bond angles) as determined by the repulsion of electron pairs according to valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory
> - Polar and non-polar character with reference to the shape of the molecule
> - The relative strengths of intramolecular bonding (covalent bonding) and intermolecular forces (dispersion forces, dipole-dipole attraction and hydrogen bonding)
> - The structure and bonding of diamond and graphite that explain their properties (including heat conductivity and electrical conductivity and hardness) and their suitability for diverse applications
> - Physical properties of molecular substances (including melting points and boiling points and non-conduction of electricity) with reference to their structure and bonding
> - Explanation of the anomalous properties of H2O (ice and water), with reference to hydrogen bonding:
>     - The density of solid ice compared with liquid water at low temperatures
>     - Trends in the boiling points of Group 16 hydrides
>     - Specific heat capacity of water including units and symbols
>  - The relatively high latent heat of vaporisation of water and its impact on the regulation of the temperature of the oceans and aquatic life
