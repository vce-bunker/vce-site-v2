a substance is plastic if it can readily mold into different shapes

**bioplastics**- renewable sourced plastics

**biodegradable**
can be broken down by microorganisms, may leave toxic residues
- compostable- non toxic and 90% biodegrade in 180 days


**Recycling**
	- mechanical- generate raw materials
		- no impact on chemical structure, loss of polymer quality
	- chemical- conversion back into building blocks
		- no loss in quality
		- energy intensive- harming environment
	- organic- broken down by living organisms
		- breaks bonds in polymer
		- eco friendly
		- more research needed
