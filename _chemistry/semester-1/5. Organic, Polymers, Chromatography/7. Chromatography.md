- separates compounds based on polarity
- stationary phase- solid surface
- mobile phase- solvent (always water in the test)
- Adsorption- accumulation of substance on stationary phase
- Desorption- when substance interacts with mobile phase
- In order to move up it must dissolve
	- like dissolves like, therefore polar moves up more
- RF- height moved/distance between starting height and solvent front

Thin layer chromatography
- identifies compounds found in mixtures
- can assess for purity
- only requires a small sample
- no expensive machinery
- separates compounds based on polarity
- stationary phase is a TLC plate (the only difference to paper chromatography)


Pop test
- H2 is flammable
