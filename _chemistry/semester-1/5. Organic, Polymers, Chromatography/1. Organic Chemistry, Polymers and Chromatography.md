> - The grouping of hydrocarbon compounds into families (alkanes, haloalkanes, alkenes, alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, esters, aldehydes and ketones) based upon similarities in their physical and chemical properties, including general formulas and general uses based on their properties
> - Reactions: Complete combustion, substitution of alkanes and addition reactions of alkenes, (addition of Br2, HCl, H2O(g))
> - Representations of organic compounds (structural formulas, skeletal, semi-structural formulas) and naming according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry(IUPAC) systematic nomenclature (limited to non-cyclic compounds up to C8, and structural isomers up to C5)
> - The differences between addition and condensation reactions as processes for producing natural and manufactured polymers from monomers
> - The formation of addition polymers by the polymerisation of alkene monomers
> - Polar and non-polar character with reference to the solubility of polar solutes dissolving in polar solvents, and non-polar solutes dissolving in non-polar solvents
> - Experimental application of chromatography as a technique to determine the composition and purity of different types of substances, including calculation of Rf values
> - The characterisation of different plastics as fossil fuel based and as bioplastics; plastic recycling (mechanical, chemical and organic), compostability, circularity and renewability of raw ingredients
> - Innovations in polymer manufacture using condensation reactions, and the breakdown of polymers using hydrolysis reactions, contributing to the transition from a linear economy towards a circular economy
