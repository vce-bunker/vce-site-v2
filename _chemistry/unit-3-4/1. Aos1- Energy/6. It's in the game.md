Activation energy - the minimum energy required to break the reactant bonds and initiate the reaction. (if the molecules are given and multiple marks- state the bonds that are broken, eg 2 O=O bonds)

Molar enthalpies of combustion in the data book all assume that the fuel is 1 mol in the equation.

Doubling all the mol in the equation still doubles the per mol value
Note that in contour they say when you double the whole equation you can't say "per mol" anymore as the fuel is no longer 1 mol (but for school still use per mol if the original had it)

Graph drawing:
1. shape (exo or endo)
2. y values, units
3. ∆H, Ea and t.p

Fuels are solid, liquid, gas. Never (aq)

**Why is ∆H lower for incomplete combustion?**
less mol of O2 available

**Enthalpy of combustion reaction**
enthalpy of combustion (kj/mol) = energy/mol

fuels eg coal cannot be expressed in kj/mol as they are mixtures of chemicals and do not have a specific formula or molar mass
