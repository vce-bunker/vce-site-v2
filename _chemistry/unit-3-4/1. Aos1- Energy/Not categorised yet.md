copy titration notes from back of general book

charges are reversed in electrolytic cels


what things do I write in a green chemistry principle question




fuel cells
- all convert electrical -> chemical

- fuel cells occur at high temp while primary and secondary aren't, so less energy efficient


porous electrodes

- not highly reactive
- expensive and not readily available
- more efficient than soluid electrolytes at moving charges and reactants

anion-anode - cation - cathode works with fuel cells too


are galvanic cells always acidic


School lab not at SLC conditions, **eg 25 * C or 100kPa*** (need this)
or:
Internal resistance in the wires
Don't use concentration as the diagram says 1M

don't write mass as observation (as it is not an observation) (say size)
Intensirt of blue colour of cu2+ (aq) decreases
Cu2+ is blue (see logbook item 7), therefore when cu2+ is removed

Danoell cell structure enable it to [rpfuce electrical energy

1. half cells musty be separated because if you don't have them separated you get heat energy,
	1. separated allows the electrons to flow through the external circuit

Response:
half cells are separated, salt bridge, mention electrons moving
half cells are separated, allowing **e- flow**
AND
salt biodge provides ions to prevent accumulation of charge and allow electrions to move via external circuit

if temperature not specified, can have the water be loquid or gas (in combustion).


chem- 80 = 2 s.f
general- 80 = 1 s.f

in the lpg fuel cell, where the oxygen goes in (not the fuel) is the cathode

the solid is the anode as it will turn into an ion (thus donate e-)

can write in dot points

## Energy efficiency

Efficiency: Useful energy (output) compared to input

% efficiency = energy obtained in desired form / original energy (as a %)

**Why is __ less efficient than __ ?**

\__ has multiple energy conversions, therefore decreased efficiency than [fuel cell] which has 1 energy conversion (chemical -> electrical). \__ has more heat loss

## Bond enthalpies
total bond enthalpies in reactants - total bond enthalpies in products = ∆H
