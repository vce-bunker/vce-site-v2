Remove dietary fibre if it is under total carbohydrates

**Explain why the energy released when food is heated is greater than the energy available to the body**
- incomplete oxidation and absorption of nutrients by the body
- humans cannot digest cellulose because they lack cellulase enzyme
	- therefore glucose cannot be hydrolysed- less energy released
