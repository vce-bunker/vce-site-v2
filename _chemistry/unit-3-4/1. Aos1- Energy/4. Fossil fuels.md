sourced from decaying organic matter


## Biofuels
*derived from biological materials or biomass* (state it), which are *produced naturally*, therefore *carbon neutral*

**Photosynthesis**
- endothermic
- positive ∆H
- reverse of cellresp
$$6CO_2(g)+6H_2O(l)\rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6(aq)+6CO_2(g)$$


**Distillation**
Separates mixtures by BP - ethanol (aq) into ethanol (l)
