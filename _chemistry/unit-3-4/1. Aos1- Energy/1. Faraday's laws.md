n = q/f
where:
Q = total electric charge (measured in C, coulombs)
F = Faraday;s constant - 96500 C/mol (in data book)
n = mol of e- (specified in data book)

Q = I * T
Where:
I = current (Amps)
t = reaction duration (seconds)

**Base question**
- Converting between (current and amps) and mols

Things to keep in mind
- use units even at the end of each step (C, etc)
