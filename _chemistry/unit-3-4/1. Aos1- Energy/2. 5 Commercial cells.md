**Electrochemical cells**
Cells which utilise redox reactions to generate electricity

**Commercial cells**
type of electrochemical cell
- Galvanic cells
	- chemical -> electrical
	- primary
	- secondary
	- fuel cells
- Electrolytic cells
	- Electrical-chemical
	- Secondary - allows recharging

**Primary cells**
- AA batteries, button cells etc
- often cheap
- cannot be recharged
- products slowly migrate from electrodes due to concentration gradient
- after some time, products befin to build up around the electrodes because there is no loner a concentration gradient. The products insulate the electrodes, polarisation has been reached, the cell goes flat.

**Fuel cells**
- efficient but expensive (electrodes, electrolytes, catalysts, high temp, storage of gases (reactants))
- continually produce electrical energy from an indirect spontaneous exothermic reaction
- combustion reaction (write this first when figuring out half equations)
- O2 half equation - 1.23V if acidic, 0.40V if alkaline (see electrochemical series)
	- electrolyte is present in the reaction but cancels out when half eqns are combined
	- second half equation is found by working backwards

| Fuel cells convert chemical directly to electrical<br>Therefore more efficient than power stations<br>Generate electricity as long as reactants are supplied, unlike batteries which have to be recharged or replaced | Require constant fuel supply<br>Expensive (eg platinum)<br>Storage of H2 transport requires a hydrogen filling station before it becomes widespread as it is flammable and can be a safety issie. (gases are stored under pressure, vessels containing the gases must withstand high pressure)<br>Most fuel cells currently use fossil fuels as the reactant - produce greenhouse gases (but H2 fuel cells don't (no CO2)) |

Pros and cons of applying green chemistry principles to fuel cells:

| In fuel cell design -> select components that are abundant, non toxic and have minimal environmental impact.<br>Virtually emission free as 1* product is water vapour, if H2(g) is used as a fuel.<br>Also, design for degradation,  use of renewable feedstocks and increased energy efficiency could be discussed. | increase costs (catalysts, membrane, electrodes etc)<br>limited infrastructure eg h2 production, storage, distribution networks<br>catalysts are costly, scarce, and can be critical elements |

To be eco friendly fuel cells can use hydrogen produced from renewable sources of biofuels derived from biomass (no net co2 emission)

Reactant characteristics (when determining what to use)
- cheap
- light
- high voltage (the 2 reactants must be far apart in elec series) (electrolytes - high ionic conductivity)
- Avoid toxic chemicals eg mercury and cadmium
- Sustainable: abundant, minimal environmental impact (also for catalysts, electrolytes etc)


**Electrolyte** (commercial cells)
Enables conductivity
- don't say e- move in electrolytes, only say they move around wire
- paste or gel (not a dilute solution), increases concentration of reactants (in primary cell)
- (fuel cell:) ==a reactant at one of the electrodes==, and a product at the other. So it never runs out.
	- prevents fuel cell and o2 from coming into direct contact, in which heat energy would be produced rather than electrical energy (hence use an indirect spontaneous reaction)
- constant (in fuel cells)
	- eg Anion OH-
		anions migrate to the anode, therefore OH- is a reactant at the anode, and therefore a prduct at the cathode
	- Cation eg H+(aq) cations migrate to the cathode, therefore H+ is a reactant at the cathode and therefore a product at the anode.

**Separator** (primary cells)
- used instead of salt bridge (for primary cells)
- It could be a gelled electrolyte
- in battery it allows electrolyte ions to move across
- Porous material allows migration but not mixing of oxidant and reductant (allows some ions to move through)
- separates the oxidising agent and the reducing agent to prevent a direct spontaneous reaction where heat energy would be released, not electrical energy.





The ethics behind it
Aus is a drought prone country. Lithium mining for batteries require large amounts of water, which should be used for crops instead.
