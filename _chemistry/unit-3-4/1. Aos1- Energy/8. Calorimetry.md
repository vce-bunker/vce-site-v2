**Calorimeter**
A thing in which you put a reaction inside to measure the reaction's temperature.
You use it because it has insulation so the reaction's heat energy won't escape or enter allowing for a more controlled environment.

**Calibration factor**
you need to calibrate the calorimeter to determine how many joules you need to heat the calorimeter per degrees celcius. (J/\*C or kJ/\*C (which is also the formula to calculate it))

Where to get the Joules/kJ in the eqn?
E (the value in question) = amps * volts * seconds

**How to use?**
1. So you've got the calibration factor of your calorimeter and you have a chemical reaction inside it.
2. since the CF is J/\*C. Then instead of the initial per degrees celsius in the CF equation, you just set it to the change in temperature of the reaction you are doing, and "scale" the J value according to that.
