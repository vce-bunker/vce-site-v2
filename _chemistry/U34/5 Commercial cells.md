**Electrochemical cells**
Cells which utilise redox reactions to generate electricity
- Galvanic cells
	- chemical -> electrical

electrodes
- porous - allow ions from the electrolyte to come into contact w. gases, allowing reduction/oxidation to occur on the electrode surface


electrolyte
- how do the H+ (or other thing) move inside it? what does it do?


fuel cells have to have porous electrodes while primary cells don't.
